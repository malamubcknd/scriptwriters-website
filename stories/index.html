                        <p class="ul-event-details-descr"> They think I sleep when the rats come out. But sleep is a kindness I no longer deserve. In this place, sleep is treason. You close your eyes, and the past creeps in, bloodied, loud, and full of teeth. The air here is thick. Not just heavy, but wrong. It sticks to your skin like a second layer of filth. The stench is unbearable, yet constant: fermented sweat, rotting food, old blood, and something sour that I can’t name but can never forget. It's the scent of people slowly breaking. The walls are wet. Always wet. The moisture drips down like tears, but the kind no one wipes away. The cracks are my calendar, and the rats my only company. I have forgotten what it feels like to laugh. The cell is a box with no mercy. A slit of a window lets in a thin trickle of light, only enough to remind you of what you're missing. This cell is not a room. It is a grave in waiting.
         <p>Asantewaa is my name, or… it used to be. Before they took it away. Before the day my sky fell and never rose again. I was the only daughter in a family of six, five strong brothers, a mother with a voice like the earth’s hum, and a father whose hands told stories without words. My brothers adored me and protected me with their lives. I was cherished beyond words at home. Even at school, the teachers loved me because I was an excellent student. We lived in a town that sat on the edge of Accra’s shadow, where kiosks and zinc-roofed shops buzzed with gossip, and tailors played loud highlife music from tiny speakers. You could still hear the mosque’s call to prayer in the morning and the cry of a hawker selling roasted groundnuts at dusk. It wasn’t quite a village, but it wasn’t modern either. It was something in between, unfinished, like me. I studied by lantern light, poring over borrowed books and scribbling notes on old papers. I passed my WASSCE with a smile wider than the Volta. But dreams need money to walk, and we had none to spare. So, I folded up my future and tucked it into the thatch of our roof. Then I returned to the land of the red earth that fed us, stained our fingernails, and kept us moving.</p>
        The day everything changed started like any other. We were coming home from the farm; our clothes soaked in sweat, and our mouths dry from the harmattan winds. We walked past neighbours roasting maize by their gates, and children dragging worn slippers through dust. We stopped briefly in the square near the community centre, where the radio was louder than usual. Then the voice came. Sharp. Strange. Commanding. “This is the word of Flight Lieutenant Rawlings. The old order is dead. The people’s revolution has begun. All strong and able-bodied men are to report to their districts. Anyone caught hiding them will face the consequences. No mercy. No delay.” I remember how my mother’s lips stopped moving mid-chew on her roasted maize. My heart slowed. Around us, the town cracked like an egg under pressure, helter-skelter everywhere, whispering, locking doors. The revolution was coming. The air changed. Even the trotro parked near the mechanic's shed fell silent. We didn’t say much on the way home. But we knew. They were coming and wouldn’t wait for an invitation. A week passed. Every sound outside our house felt like a warning. We were all pretending to be normal, but nothing was.</p>
       Then came the day. That faithful morning. I had secretly taken Kwaku's bicycle to the market, trying to hurry. I had hoped to buy Aunty Ekua’s doughnuts before I finished my chores, because by the time I usually finished, she would be out. However, I was careless. The road was broken, and the wheel hit a stone and snapped. I wasn’t hurt, just a scratch on my knee. Most of the damage was to the bike. I panicked and stashed the bike behind the shed. I knew Kwaku would be furious, and he would wake up soon. So, I ran inside and hid in the old closet behind the house. I sat with my knees pulled up to my chest, tucked between faded cloth and old market baskets. I held my breath not out of fear of Kwaku, but because something about the day already felt wrong. Heavy. Then I heard it. The thudding of feet. Screaming in the distance. Shouts. And then</p>
“Maame! Maame Asantewaa!”</p>
It was my mother. She burst through the front door, barefoot and breathless. Her clothes were coming undone. Her face was soaked in sweat and streaked with fear and panic.</p>
“They’re coming!” she shouted, stumbling forward.</p>
 “They’re in the square already. They’re taking the boys. They’re going house to house!”</p>
        My brothers rushed into the main room, still sleepy, still half believing this was a nightmare. My father was behind them, slow to arrive, confusion etched into the corners of his eyes. He didn’t understand what his wife was on about. He just stood there, staring at his wife like she had come home from the grave. The door crashed open. The soldiers entered like thunder. No warning. No words. Just rage in uniforms. The first one stepped forward and, without hesitation, slit my father’s throat. Just like that. No question. No explanation. He fell. His body hit the floor with a thud that I still hear when I close my eyes. Blood gushed from his neck like a waterfall. I had never seen so much blood in my life. My mother collapsed beside him, screaming his name repeatedly like she could bring him back with words.</p>
“K-Kojo! Kojo! Wake up… wake up!”</p>
         My brothers were shouting now. Not in anger but shock, in horror. They tried to move. Tried to reach for her. But the soldiers surrounded them, beat them into the floorboards, and tied their wrists and ankles like cattle. I could hear my brothers grunting, choking on their pain. I could hear the slap of boots on skin. I could hear my mother’s cries stretching until they were just sounds. Then came silence. Before I could make sense of it, they turned to her. Two men grabbed her. She kicked, screamed, cried, and begged, but it didn’t matter. They dragged her into the middle of the room, in our home, and tore her clothes from her body. One by one, they took her. I couldn’t move.  I couldn’t look away. I couldn’t cry. They raped her. Each of them. In our living room. On the floor where I learnt to crawl, I was helpless. Her screams shook the ceiling. She screamed until her voice broke. Then whimpered. Then fell silent. Her body was limp, shaking, bleeding. My brothers were forced to watch, bound, broken, weeping. I saw life leave her eyes. When they were done, they dropped her like a rag. Her eyes were wide open, but they were empty. A broken shell.</p>
             I was still in the closet. Frozen. Cowardly. A statue of salt and shame. One soldier looked down at her, almost bored. He pulled out his knife, small, clean, and bent beside her. I wanted to scream. I wanted to move. I wanted to die before I saw what he did next. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t move a single limb. He slit her throat as easily as someone opening a letter. Then he stood and left. My brothers were dragged out of the house, kicking and sobbing and silent. The soldiers didn’t look back. I stayed in that closet for what felt like years, soaked in urine, shaking in my skin. Heart screaming and soul shattering. I didn’t cry. I didn’t move. I just listened to the echo of my mother’s final breath, trapped between blood and memory as she whispered my name.</p>
          I don’t remember how long I stayed in the closet, but it was long enough for my limbs to forget they belonged to me. When I finally stepped out, the house was still. Still, but not silent. I could hear the way the air moved. The town was so quiet. A part of me hoped with all my heart that it was a dream. That I would open my eyes and hear Kwahu cursing about his bicycle, that I would open my eyes, and my mother would be screaming at me for not finishing my chores. I was rudely brought back to reality with the heavy stench of blood in the room. I fell by the lifeless bodies of my parents. They both still had their eyes open. When I stepped out of the closet, the air had changed.</p>

The blood had dried. The house, still. But something in me had split like a gourd cracked down the middle. I no longer moved like a girl. I moved like an echo. A memory. Something left behind. It was Aku who found me. My mother’s closest friend. She lived two compounds away, in the house with the blue door. Just took my hand and led me away. I was still. I was numb. That night, we buried my parents in the backyard. The soil behind Aku’s house was soft and still smelled of last season’s maize. We dug two graves side by side, wrapped their bodies in white, and placed stones at their heads. No priest. No crowd. Just me, Aku, and the wind. The bodies were heavy, and I never expected to lose my parents this way, but still, no tears fell. I didn’t say goodbye. I didn’t even pray. Because what prayer do you offer to a God who looked away?</p>
       Living with Aku felt like drowning with your eyes open. She gave me a room of my own. A narrow bed, a faded mosquito net, a small window with iron bars. She cooked for me, spoke gently, and never pushed. But grief doesn’t respond to kindness. It lingers. It hides in the soft things. I tried to help her around the house. Tried to sweep, fetch water, and grind pepper. But my hands shook when I picked up a knife. I couldn’t bear the sound of slamming doors. Couldn’t look anyone in the eye. At night, I didn’t sleep. I saw my mother’s face. My father’s throat. The soldiers. The blood. Every time I closed my eyes, it happened again. And again. I started scratching my arms until they bled, just to feel something else. But Aku saw me. Not just the girl I was, but the one I might still become. She started giving me small things to do. Little seeds of purpose. Fix the hem on her wrapper. Peel the yam for dinner. Read from the Bible, even when I just mouthed the words. She told me stories about my mother. How she used to sing in the rain. How she once climbed a palm tree just to prove my father wrong. How brave she was. All the adventures before I was born, and with each story, I felt my heart slowly start to beat life into me. It was refreshing. I had grieved for so long that I had forgotten how it felt to laugh. At first, I didn’t believe her. I couldn’t match that woman with the broken body I had seen. But slowly, the stories stitched themselves into me. My mother was a lot braver than I thought she was, and I was proud of her.</p>
     I began to write. First, on old newspapers. Then, in a little notebook Aku gave me from her days as a seamstress’s apprentice. I wrote letters I would never send. Wrote names I would never forget. Wrote pain I couldn’t say out loud. Those pages felt like an escape from my bitter reality. For the first time in forever, I felt I could control everything. And through it all, I began to imagine something dangerous. A future. It wasn’t sudden. Healing never is, but one morning, almost a year to the day after my sky fell, I woke up before the sun. I stepped outside. The air was wet with dew. I stood before the graves. I hadn’t been back here since the burial. I ran my fingers across the stone, and I whispered something. Not a goodbye.</p>
Just: “I’m going now.”</p>
I felt a gust of wind across my body. It was as if they were giving me their blessing to move on in life. I packed my things. Aku had bought me a small grey suitcase when I told her about my plans. She was ecstatic about my decision. Aku didn’t ask where I was going. She only held me for a long time and slipped a few cedis into my palm.</p>
“I knew your mother,” she said softly. “And I know you. You have so much more to offer.”</p>
     The lorry to Accra was loud and full of sweating bodies. I sat by the window, watching the trees lean and pass. I didn’t cry when we pulled out of town. I didn’t flinch when a soldier passed at the checkpoint. I was no longer a ghost. My escape from reality through a pencil was short-lived, as I heard a clang. The sound cut through my memories like a blade, my life before the storm faded, and once again, I was faced by damp walls. A rusted door. The same stain in the corner that I had stopped trying to clean with my spit and fingernails. I didn’t look at the food; there was no need. I already knew what it was. The heat had long died from the beans. The soup, if you could call it that, had separated into sludge and grease. I picked up the corner of the tin plate, stared at it, and wondered what was more dangerous: the hunger or the taste. I set it down again. There was no desire left in me, not for food, not for hope, not for anything. I had fought. I had survived. I had spoken when silence would have been easier. And still, here I was. In chains. Broken again. </p>
      Outside these walls, Ghana bled slowly. The memory of May 16th, 1979, still cast its long shadow across the land. The Rawlings regime, baptized in the name of justice, had become a gospel of fear. Soldiers patrolled dusty roads with rifles too long for their shoulders. Names disappeared from registers. Voices disappeared from the radio. They called it “housecleaning.” But it wasn’t dirt they were scrubbing. It was dissent. Poverty and famine like never been seen before. It was hideous. Women on the street crying, begging for food to feed their dying children. Collarbones became so hollow that they could carry water. Rawlings’ chain, they called it. In Makola, women were stripped and lashed for selling above the price control. The regime claimed it was the will of the people.   But if the people ever had a voice, it had been drowned in the flood of fear. Justices who stood up to the regime were stripped of their lives, and their bodies were found half burnt at the Bundase camp. And the boots kept marching.</p>
     A slip of paper found its way into my cell, folded tight and pushed through the smallest crack where light used to visit. I didn’t have to guess. It was from Kwabena, the only soldier here who still remembered how to be human. No words. Just space. And that was enough. I reached beneath my mattress, fingers fumbling for the stub of a pencil I’d hidden weeks ago. It had been sharpened against the wall so many times that it was barely longer than my thumb. Still, it would do. I wiped my hands on my skirt, smoothed the paper against my thigh, and began to write again. </p>
   "Accra met me like a slap. The air was hot, the people were loud, and the city didn’t care that I came carrying the bones of my parents in my chest. It didn’t care that I had seen my brothers bound like animals. It didn’t ask me who I was. And maybe that’s why I survived it. Because for the first time, I was just a girl. No story. No blood. No past. I stayed with my mother’s cousin in a compound house near Nima. She didn’t have much, but she gave me space to sleep, and food when there was enough. I sold sachet water during the day. On good days, I scrubbed the floors at a chop bar in New Town.  At night, I wrote. Not for beauty. Not for peace. Just to keep the screaming quiet."  I had been in this cold town for a few years when I found them by accident. A gathering of strange people in a half-burnt classroom. At first, I thought they were just talking about food shortages, soldiers, and ration cards. But then I heard one woman say:</p>
'They took my daughter in ’82. She was only twelve,' she said as a tear rolled down her cheek.</p>
The room fell silent. That silence felt like home. We called ourselves nothing at first. But we came back, week after week, pulled by grief and something harder, something like fury. They came from all corners: a former teacher whose brother was executed without trial. A fisherman who hadn’t seen his wife since the military raided their village. A girl who had only ever known her mother’s name from a burnt letter. We remembered. And then we began to speak. We didn’t have guns. We didn’t wear uniforms. But our stories had power. I found my voice in that room. And when I spoke, I saw it in their eyes that spark. That trembling thing that says, "I thought I was the only one." "We became more than a room. We became a movement. We wrote pamphlets. Each piece of paper tells our story. We smuggled testimonies into student circles protesting the Almighty regime. We rallied the people. We moved to different towns to strengthen our numbers, all while the regime had gotten wind of our activities, and they were not happy.</p>
     One night, I stood in the middle of a square in Osu and read my story aloud. “I am a victim of this regime, of how cruel and merciless they are. I watched them kill my parents in cold blood and take my brothers from me. They took my life, my family, my home, but they will never take my voice.” I shouted at the top of my lungs. The crowd at Osu had soldiers among them, and they arrested me the next morning. I didn’t flinch. Not when they slapped me. Not when they dragged me through the barracks with a bag over my head. Because by then, I had already made peace with this truth: They could chain my hands, but not my words. Not my voice. Once the bag was taken off, I saw a few of the people in the movement, bound and in tears. I was thrown into a cell, and my execution was ordered. I was given ten days, and today is day eight. I folded the paper carefully and slid it back under the bed, placing it beside the other papers.</p>
     I didn’t touch the food. I sat against the wall, arms folded, eyes closed and whispered the names of everyone who had ever stood with me. With each name came a wonderful memory. Then I whispered the names of the dead. I saw my mother. She touched my face and whispered that she was proud of me. Of the strong girl I had become. An unwelcome tear dropped, and I had no energy to wipe it off, so I let it flow. Then I whispered mine.</p>
Asantewaa.</p>
And even in this darkness, even in this rotting, forgotten place, my name still tasted like fire. It was unfortunate that this fire was about to go out. I closed my eyes and called it a night. </p>
   I was awoken by screams the next morning. It was one of the girls in the resistance. Her day of death had come. She fought with all her might. I wondered where she even got the energy from. She screamed and cried and begged, and within a few minutes, she disappeared from my eyes. I fell on the floor by the plate of food I had left the day before. The nice guard came back and made a gesture at me. I figured he wanted the plate back. I gave it to him, and our eyes met for the first time since I have been here. For the first time, I felt warmth, just from looking into his eyes. He grabbed the plate and wandered off. I looked under the bed where I had hidden the pieces of paper. Over eight days, I had written my life on these papers, my story, my truth, my life. In less than forty-eight hours, I was to die. How wonderful! I brought them out and held each one close to my chest. I sighed. So, was this the end? Is this the way I lose my voice, by the same hands that took my life? No, if I were going to die, I would do it on my terms, my way. I lay facing the ceiling, the light peeped from the cracks in the wall. I’m sure this was not the fate Aku wanted for me when she sent me here. You could hear screams from outside, people crying as bodies dropped to the floor. Some soldiers laughed as they passed by our cells. Mimicking the cries of those being executed. I felt disgusted. Did these people have no heart?</p>
      Kwabena came in with lunch, or what passes for it here. The first meal of the day. A sludgy mess of maize and something I couldn’t name. I didn’t care for it anymore. But I cared for him. Not because he was kind. But because he was quiet. And quiet, in this place, is rare. As he slid the tin bowl into the cell, I didn’t reach for it. I reached for his hand. He froze. Startled. Maybe afraid. But I didn’t let go.</p>
"Please," I whispered, voice brittle as dry leaves. "Please… when I’m gone, take the papers."</p>
He followed my eyes as I pointed to the space under my bed, the little collection of scraps I’d written on, smuggled in, one piece at a time.</p>
“Tell them,” I said, barely getting the words out, “tell someone I was here. That I lived. That they took everything from me.” His jaw clenched. He looked away. “I’m begging you, Kwabena.” He nodded, slowly. Almost like a bow. I think he understood more than he let on. But I wasn’t done. I tightened my grip. “One more thing.” He looked back at me. I don’t know what he saw in my eyes, maybe the truth, maybe the end, but he didn’t pull away. </p>
“I need a knife.”</p>
He stepped back immediately, shaking his head. “No… no, I can’t”. “Tomorrow is the day,” I interrupted. “First light.” He blinked. It was the first time I’d seen him speak with his whole face. Not just with glances and silences. “You don’t ......have to do this... you can....,” his eyes flickering, stepping closer again. I looked at him, “But you know I will.” A beat of silence passed between us, heavy as chains. I smiled. It was small, weak, but it was there.</p>
 “There’s no running from this, Kwabena. Not here. Not in this country. I’ve seen too much to believe in escape.” He looked at me like he was carrying something heavy in his chest. Regret, maybe. Or shame. Maybe both. “I’m going to die,” I said quietly. “At least let me do it with dignity.” He was still for a long time. Then, finally, he nodded. Just once. I didn’t say thank you. I just looked at him. Let my eyes do what words no longer could. And then he left slower than usual. But I knew he’d be back. </p>
With what I asked for.</p>
With my ending.</p>
With my freedom.</p>

The air was still. As if the walls themselves were holding their breath. It was almost dusk when Kwabena returned. He didn’t speak. Not at first. He stood by the door, the way he always did, but something about his presence was different. Heavy. Final. He knelt and slid something through the tiny hatch; something wrapped carefully in cloth. I didn’t unwrap it immediately. I looked at him, my fingers trembling. His eyes met mine for the first time in days, and this time, he didn’t look away.</p>
  “There’s paper inside,” he murmured. His voice was soft, hoarse, like it hadn’t been used in years. “And a pen. Thought you’d… want to say goodbye. Your way.” My breath caught. I nodded, but the tears came anyway. Quiet ones. The kind that burned, not because of sadness, but because of release. Then he paused, uncertain. He glanced at the walls, then leaned in slightly. “The knife… It’s beneath the cloth.” I reached through the hatch and squeezed his hand. “Thank you,” I said. The words barely passed my lips. He looked at me, truly looked, then gave a small bow, not military, not protocol. Something gentler. Almost reverent. And then he was gone. I sat cross-legged on the cold concrete floor, placing the bundle in front of me like a sacred offering. Carefully, I unwrapped it. The knife glinted once, then stilled, a slender, sharp salvation. Beside it, two sheets of paper and a blue pen, the ink slightly faded. I took the pen first. Let it rest between my fingers. My last companion. Then I began to write:</p>
To the ones who loved me, and to the ones who will never know I lived…</p>
I was a daughter. A sister. A girl who once believed her life would be filled with books and laughter and the sound of ripe plantains sizzling in palm oil. I was born Asantewaa in a town that lived between dust and hope. They took everything from me. My father’s voice. My mother’s laughter. My brothers' songs. They took the sun from my sky and the ground from under my feet. But they did not take my voice. Not entirely. If you are reading this, then know I lived. I remembered. I wrote it down. So that one day, when Ghana has healed, truly healed, someone will find my words and say, “This is what they did. This is why we never forget.” I have no more strength left to fight in flesh, but in ink, I leave a war cry. Do not let them silence you. Not the men in boots. Not the ones in office chairs with blood on their hands and smiles on their faces. If you have survived, rise. If you have fallen, write. If you have nothing left to say. Even with trembling lips. Even with shaking hands. This country is worth saving. And so are you. Remember me not for how I died. But for how I dared to speak.</p>
Farewell.</p>
Asantewaa.
I folded the letter and kissed it once. My hand found the knife. And in the silence of that prison, in the shadow of a broken nation, I whispered my parents' name and sat up against the wall. It was light. Too light for what it carried. I held it like a secret, like something sacred. My palms were steady now, no more trembling. No more fear. Only the strange, aching quiet of clarity. I sat back, my spine resting against the cold wall, the blade glinting softly in the dim shaft of moonlight that had slipped in through the cracks above. Outside, the world had settled into its cruel rhythm. Somewhere beyond these walls, soldiers marched. Families whispered in fear. A mother rocked a child who would never know peace. The night air carried the sharp tang of smoke, like the country itself was burning from the inside out. But here… in this small, forgotten cell… it was still. I closed my eyes.</p>
    I saw my mother’s hands firm, calloused, kind. I saw her, braiding my hair, holding my face, the night before the world ended. I saw my father’s shoulders as he walked ahead of me through the fields, humming songs that only made sense in sunlight. And I heard them now. Not the memory of them, no, but something deeper. Something alive. Their voices, gentle and warm, calling me across the distance.</p>
“Asantewaa.”</p>
I exhaled. Then, for a while, there was only silence. No screams. No footsteps. Just the hush of breath and blade and memory. First light finally came.</p>
And then,</p>
A clang.</p>
Metal. Keys. Footsteps, fast and frantic. Voices muffled behind doors. Screams.</p>
And when the guards opened the cell, what they found or didn’t find was never spoken of in full. Some say I was slumped against the wall, eyes closed, as if I had finally fallen asleep. Some say the blade was untouched, others say there was so much blood.</p>
 I guess we’ll never know.</p>

                        <p>I am Hilda Akosua Konadu Karikari, a Law student of Presbytery University Ghana. I came about this contest through a friend and the theme stood out to me. This was my first time writing in a Ghanaian setting and it was challenging to say the least. I almost didn't write it because it was outside my comfort zone. Now I am glad I took up the challenge. Fire in my name was inspired by my mum who the main character is named after. Her perseverance and determination in life gave me the tools I needed to develop the character in this story. The rest came from my love of history and the individual experiences faced by the people who lived through that era. I encourage future writers not to shy away from daunting themes but to embrace them. If you attempt it, you might like the challenge and find it easier than expected. I most certainly enjoyed it.</p>

                        <h2 class="ul-event-details-title">Echoes of Chalk and Dreams: Life in Ghana’s Senior High Schools (2nd Winner)</h2>
                        <p class="ul-event-details-descr"> There is a certain poetry to school life, the ringing of the morning bell, the scraping of sandals on dusty floors, the chaotic rhythm of classrooms buzzing with youthful energy. In Ghana, this poetry reaches its most intense and unforgettable stanzas in senior high school. It is more than just an academic phase; it is indeed a rite of passage. Within the four walls of classrooms and the wide-open spaces of dining halls and dormitories, Ghanaian teenagers undergo a transformation that shapes their identity, values, and lifelong aspirations. </p>
For many students, senior high school (SHS) represents both freedom and responsibility. It is a melting pot of laughter and pressure, of friendship and competition, of youthful rebellion and emerging discipline. From Form One(1) to Form Three(3), school life becomes a journey filled with defining moments — late-night studies with flashlights, house chores under strict housemasters, spirited inter-school debates, and heated football rivalries that bind students together like family. This essay dives into the heartbeat of SHS life in Ghana; not from the viewpoint of policies and statistics, but through the eyes of the students who live it. It is a tale of chalkboards, sleepless nights, smuggled phones, and lifelong bonds. Welcome to the world where dreams are shaped — one school bell at a time. </p>
The journey begins with the first step through the school gates. For most first-year students, known as </p>
“Freshers” or “form one boys/girls,” that first day is a cocktail party of excitement accompanied with fear and anxiety. Parents wave tearful goodbyes, trunks and chop boxes are dragged to dormitories, and the reality of boarding life begins to settle. Senior students, usually eager to assert their authority, begin to assign chores, sometimes harmless, other times exaggerated to ensure students have a feel of life in school. It’s not hazing in the Western sense, but a cultural induction of sorts. Learning how to sweep well or polish shoes with a banana peel to shine as gold suddenly becomes a life lesson. The fear of seniors fades as bonds grow and routines become second nature. That is when people find school parents; school mum and dad strengthening bonds between senior students and “Freshers,” we call it. The first day teaches a memorable and unforgettable lesson in SHS—adjustment and adaptability are the two key things you must know. One must quickly learn how to survive with limited water, make friends fast, and memorize the names of all friends, classmates, and most importantly dining hall prefects in order to abscond the risk of going hungry. </p>
That initiation phase is only the beginning of an evolving story. Within the first few weeks, freshers are already mimicking senior lingo, learning songs that are sung at morning assemblies, and adapting to the communal lifestyle. Dorm life, though chaotic, teaches shared responsibility. Imagine twenty students in one room, each bringing their own personality, background, and habits. Some snore, others hum in their sleep, and there’s always that one student who wakes everyone up with an early devotional hymn. It is a life of compromise and learning how to coexist with others from different regions, ethnicities, and belief systems. You realize quickly that school is a microcosm of Ghana itself — rich in diversity and united by purpose. </p>
The classroom is the heart of every SHS, and academic work is no joke. Ghanaian students are not strangers when it comes to high academic expectations, especially with the pressure to perform well in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). Classes often begin as early as 7:00 AM and extend into prep sessions that end at 9:00 PM. Students are given at least two break times, with which one is used for breaking the usual night fast and the other for lunch before school closes. Normally, evening preps start at 7:00 PM where assignments, research, and personal studies are done to ensure a prepared mind for the next day. Teachers are both mentors and disciplinarians. Some inspire students with real passion; quoting Shakespeare with flair, solving calculus like poetry, or turning Biology into a storytelling session where different mnemonics like “My Very Eyes May Just See Under Nine Planets,” a very popular mnemonic for memorizing the nine planets in the solar system. </p>
Others are feared more than loved, due to their sharp demoralizing words and even sharper canes. Students often dread these teachers' classes but later realize that their strictness comes from a desire to see them succeed. </p>
There’s also the phenomenon of group studies, where “sharks” lead others in discussing difficult topics, or </p>
when notes from other schools are smuggled and photocopied because they’re “better explained.” These moments of teamwork in the face of academic pressure create a powerful sense of community. Exams and tests are stressful, but they also push students to develop strong study habits and mental endurance. Late-night learning under torchlight becomes the norm, especially during revision week. </p>
But amidst the pressure, students develop values such as discipline. They learn the art of time management, study techniques like “group studies and presentations,” studying under mango trees, and developing a deep interest in some subjects. It’s very common to find students arguing over math problems after lights out, whispering equations under mosquito nets and being punished by dormitory captains for making noise. If academics form the spine of SHS, social life is the soul. The friendships formed in SHS often last a lifetime. From shared meals of Gari soakings to group punishments like weeding overgrown grass, students find common ground to learn, admire, and grow into each other’s lives. </p>
Clans naturally form: the “bookworms” students, the athletes, the “front seaters” in church and social gatherings, the debaters, the choristers, the “sharks,” the drama kings and queens, and of course, the “bunk lords” who always seem to have extra provisions hidden in their trunks that you may never know unless you are a very close friend indeed. There’s also a unique school culture in every SHS being the school anthems, morning assemblies, chants during inter-house sports, and slang only insiders understand, songs some departments can only sing, and many others. Each school has its pride, its rivalries, and its traditions as well. Whether you’re from Breman Asikuma Senior High School, Legon Presec, Wesley Girls, Opoku Ware, or Holy Child, you carry a badge of identity that no one can take from you. This badge makes you different when schools come together to strengthen ties. </p>
Ask any SHS student in Ghana what they remember most, and food that was served in their dining halls will definitely be the first idea to pop up. Not necessarily for its taste, but for the awesome memories it carries. </p>
Meals in the dining hall is an adventure. From the occasional “concrete kenkey” to the legendary watery light soup they call it, students learn the true meaning of adaptation, humility and admiration. That’s where gari soaking: a mix of gari, sugar, milk (if lucky), groundnuts, and water from the borehole, becomes both an expensive snack and a savior. It’s not just food but a culture as well. The dining hall also doubles as a comedy theatre where most jokes and gags are created. Students create nicknames for some special foods, impersonate teachers, and sneak in biscuits hidden in socks. Mealtime is when friends bond, secrets are shared, and school politics is discussed over spoons and laughter. </p>
There’s also the matter of dining hall seating arrangements — where you sit can say a lot about who you are. New students learn to find good spots quickly or risk eating under the watchful eye of a hungry prefect. Some students develop stealthy tactics to secure a second serving, especially on Sundays when rice and stew is in rotation. Despite the simplicity of the meals, the conversations and laughter shared around food form some of the most memorable moments in a student’s life. </p>
Every Ghanaian SHS has a house system for easy recognition and speedy assistance. Students are divided into houses; usually named after historical figures, virtues, and most times, founders of the school. These houses compete in every activity worth to be called competitions, from sports to sanitation, and loyalty runs deep. Discipline and time consciousness are the cornerstone of life in senior high school. Prefects are given real authority; some use it well, others abuse it. Housemasters and mistresses together with the management of the school help maintain law and order, by often using simple and creative punishments such as scrubbing bathrooms, writing lines, or “picking stones” under the sun and more. While some rules feel strict or outdated, they instill a sense of respect, order, and personal responsibility in students. Students may moan about these strict rules, but years later, they laugh about it, and often admit it helped them become better and very responsible adults. </p>
Despite the strict routines and ordeals, SHS isn’t all work. There’s an avenue for releasing course work stress and refreshing minds. Saturday night entertainment shows, school drama performances, and inter-house spelling bee and inter-school quiz competitions bring joy and relief. Debate teams battle it out with verve and passion. Sports teams carry the hopes of entire schools during Super Zonals Sports Competitions. Entertainment nights are where most students are granted the opportunity to showcase their hidden talents to the entire school, from rap battles to cultural dances. This is where the bookworms are penalized for being absent for social gatherings only to realize they were studying during the course of entertainment shows. </p>
And of course, there’s always that one school actor who mimics the headmaster or the headmistress too well than everyone can do. Music plays a big role in SHS life. Dormitories echo with Azonto beats or soft gospel music such as “Aseda Nuom,” my favourite among the lots, during evening devotions. Some students form music groups for the school or learn how to play instruments in the school’s church. Not to forget this school instrumentalist are mostly those you see with girls but may end up advising you in a way as if they know about the second coming of Jesus Christ. Others find solace in writing lyrics or sketching in their notebooks; tiny acts of rebellion or self-expression. </p>
Even in a disciplined environment, emotions blossom. Teenage years in school are a time of self-discovery, and SHS life introduces students to feelings of attraction, heartbreak, and admiration. From anonymous love letters to nervous smiles during entertainment nights, SHS is where many experience their first crush and where most people make their first proposals. Despite the fact that the official school rules often discourage romantic relationships, the feelings are real. Whispered conversations during break time, coded nicknames, and innocent notes slipped secretly under doors. </p>
These moments may seem trivial, but they play a huge role in shaping the emotional maturity of students. Students learn how to navigate feelings, respect boundaries, and deal with rejection and stigmatization; life lessons are just as important as anything learned in class. By the time students reach Form Three, their final year in school, they have become the seniors they once feared. Uniforms fit differently, academic responsibilities increase while house work decreases, and the countdown to the West African Senior School Certificate Examination commonly known as WASSCE begins. </p>
Final-year students juggle preparation with homesickness. This tension created brings back the minds of the unserious, forcing them to study thoroughly. This is the only time where the school dancer will sit by his book for about three (3) hours or even more. This is the time every moment feels like the last where you would hear people say today might be our; “last visiting day,” “our last roll call,” “our last joke under the tree behind the dining hall.” People start to think about life after Senior High School at this very moment. WASSCE emerges like a storm cloud, but so does the excitement of life beyond SHS. There’s a maturity in final-year students, a certain pride in how far they’ve come. When the final bell of school completion rings, tears fall; not because they failed, but because they’re saying goodbye to a life teacher that inculcated into them the best values of life and a world that made them who they are. </p>
Senior high school in Ghana is more than just a stepping stone to university. It is a world of its own, full of life-learnt lessons, struggles, laughter, identity, and growth. It’s where students learn how to think critically, build friendships, endure challenges, adapt to environmental changes, and chase dreams. Long after the uniforms are folded away and the school compound becomes a memory, the lessons of SHS forever remain. They echo in job interviews, in acts of kindness, in personal strength, and in sentimental stories told years later. School life, especially in Ghana’s senior high schools, is not just about books or grades. It is about the journey of becoming someone in the future, one morning bell, one prep session, one friend, and one memory at a time. </p>

                        <p>I am Justice Owusu. I'm an eighteen year old (18) Ghanaian with the passion of telling stories that reflect real-life experiences, growth and emotions. My writing is inspired by everyday moments and familiar environments.</p>
I started my Basic Education at Ave Maria Preparatory School where life as a student began. I became the compound overseer of the school due to my dedication for cleanliness. I was very committed and hence was loved by all. After completing, I gained admission to study general science at Breman Asikuma Senior High School abbreviated as BASS. I dedicated most of my time to studies and religion. I later became the Boys' Academic Prefect of the school. Due to my dedication to religious activities in the school, I was appointed as the denominational president for the Non-Methodist Denomination ( A joint denominational session for all students who were neither methodists nor Muslims) of my school. Aside from all these achievements, I had the opportunity to join the National Science and Maths Quiz Team of my school. My achievement inspired many and I became the role model of some pupils before completing the school. </p>
My greatest inspiration was centered on the strong desire I had to create scenes and put them into writing.</p>
An advice I have for upcoming writers is that: never should they limit themselves to imaginations only but rather try. As one of my favourite quotes says; "A task remains practically impossible until it is done". Dear upcoming writers, be eager to do what is seen to be impossible.</p>

                        <p class="ul-event-details-descr"> The sun rose slowly over Kumasi, its golden rays filtering through thick groves of palm and cocoa trees. The smell of earth, firewood, and early-morning shea butter clung to the wind. In the distance, the sacred Fontomfrom drums echoed across the royal courtyard - not in rhythm for celebration, but for counsel. Trouble was brewing in the heart of the Ashanti Empire.</p>
At the center of the palace grounds stood the Aban Adwa, the Council Hall, carved from the richest Odum wood and adorned with golden stools and the ivory tusks of fallen elephants. Within its cool interior sat King Kwarteng Agyemang, the Asantehene of Kumasi - tall, dark, and crowned in kente, but with eyes troubled by shadows. He was no weakling; he had led warriors to battle against the Dagomba and resisted British overtures with clever diplomacy. But this - this was different.</p>
Whispers of rebellion had slithered through the palace like a viper. There had been theft in the royal treasury, unusual gatherings of young men in the market square at night, and most disturbing of all, a missing golden stool from a minor village chiefdom - a symbol of allegiance and power.</p>
Beside the King stood Queen Akosua Serwaa, a woman of fierce beauty and fiercer mind. Born of royal blood from Akyem Abuakwa, her wisdom was sought even by men who once scoffed at women in politics. She had warned the King months ago about unrest, but he had been blinded by loyalty - particularly to one man.</p>
That man - Kojo Bempah, Commander of the Royal Guard - once saved the King’s life in a surprise ambush near Techiman. But now, tongues wagged that Bempah was plotting his own destiny, dreaming not just of command, but of the throne itself.</p>
As the council assembled that morning, war drums from the east signaled something grave. A messenger, breathless and bleeding, stumbled into the hall and fell to his knees before the King.</p>
“Nana... the Adontenhene has been assassinated. Poisoned. In his own courtyard.”</p>
Gasps filled the hall.</p>
The King’s grip tightened on the arm of his golden stool. The Adontenhene - leader of the vanguard warriors - had supported the King’s reforms to curb corruption among the inner chiefs. His death was no coincidence. It was a warning.</p>
“Who dares defile our kingdom with blood and treachery?” the King bellowed.</p>
But in the silence that followed, his eyes drifted to Kojo Bempah - stoic, loyal, and yet unreadable.</p>
The Queen narrowed her gaze too. She knew war was coming, but it might not be fought on the battlefield. It would be waged in whispers, alliances, betrayals - and only the most cunning would survive.</p>
In the Ashanti Empire, the throne did not only belong to the strongest. It belonged to the most patient.</p>
 In the weeks that followed the Adontenhene’s death, the palace of Kumasi became a maze of uncertainty. At dawn, the market women still sang, and children still played around the palace walls. </p>
But beneath the cheerful chatter, fear simmered. Spies moved like spirits through the streets; loyalty became a question whispered in backrooms. The city wore its silence like a mask.</p>
King Kwarteng summoned the Council of Elders, a rare move outside of annual customs. They arrived in full regalia - some bare-chested, others adorned in animal skins, with gold rings and ivory bracelets gleaming under the torchlight. The King sat high on his stool, guarded by Kojo Bempah, whose hand never strayed far from the hilt of his ivory-hilted sword.</p>
“The kingdom is bleeding from within,” the King said gravely. “We must act, or the blood will rise to drown the golden stool.”</p>
Old Chief Nana Kofi Boahen, the linguist of the Eastern provinces, stood with the aid of his staff. “Nana, the blood begins with gold. The stolen stool from Aduem is not just an artifact - it was a pledge of loyalty. Its theft is an act of war.”</p>
Kojo Bempah leaned forward. “Then let us declare war. Root out the traitors. Burn the bush to flush out the snake.”</p>
But Queen Akosua rose and countered him. “A snake will not run from fire- it hides deeper in the roots. We must not just strike. We must understand who fed the snake.”</p>
The council murmured. The Queen’s words unsettled them, for they hinted at a deeper rot.</p>
Unknown to the King, Kojo Bempah had begun convening secret meetings under the guise of night patrols. Deep within the stone catacombs beneath the city -  once used to store gold dust - he met with discontented junior chiefs, palace guards, and ambitious traders. His words were sharp and calculated:</p>
“Did our ancestors fight the British just to kneel under one man’s reforms? The King gives the white men treaties, reduces our tributes, and limits your share of the royal earnings. And who whispers into his ear at night? A woman!”</p>
He paced before them, his voice rising.</p>
“The Ashanti Empire was built on conquest, not compromise. It’s time the throne returned to warriors - not talkers.”</p>
Cheers echoed through the stone walls. A plan was laid - to assassinate not the King, but Queen Akosua, whose influence was stronger than many realized.</p>
</p>
While the Queen remained inside the palace grounds, she had eyes everywhere. Afia Mensima, her handmaiden, moved freely between palace and market. Trained in listening more than speaking, she heard of a gathering planned in the city’s north quarter - strange for a day with no funeral or festival.</p>
Afia rushed back, panting.</p>
“My Queen, there’s a plot. They plan to strike during the festival of Akwasidae. You are their target.”</p>
The Queen did not flinch. Instead, she went to her private shrine and prayed before the effigy of Yaa Asantewaa, lighting a single flame.</p>
“If the stool must be defended by women again,” she whispered, “let it be so.”</p>
The day arrived. Kumasi blossomed with color - crimson, gold, and deep green fabrics flowing through the streets. Drummers pounded rhythms that told stories older than memory. Dancers performed in circles, and libations were poured to the ancestors.</p>
The King, robed in fine kente and flanked by guards, took his seat atop a raised platform. Queen Akosua walked beside him in majestic silence, a golden eagle feather in her hair - a signal to those who knew that she was watching.</p>
Among the crowd, hidden beneath ceremonial clothes, Kojo Bempah’s men waited for a signal. One was dressed as a drummer. Another carried a disguised blade in a calabash. Their target was not the King, but the Queen. Without her, the King’s inner circle would fracture.</p>
But the Queen had anticipated this. She had quietly replaced the real palace guards with her own loyal fighters - women trained in knife combat, dressed as dancers.</p>
As the crowd shouted and danced, a drummer inched closer to the royal dais, raising his stick not to beat, but to strike.</p>
In a flash, a dancer spun, kicked the calabash out of his hand, and drew a blade from beneath her cloth. Chaos erupted.</p>
“Assassins!” someone cried.</p>
The King stood, fury in his voice. “Secure the Queen!”</p>
But Queen Akosua had already moved, dragging her startled husband down the back of the platform as arrows flew through the air. One struck the stool where he had just been seated.</p>
Kojo Bempah, standing at the edge of the square, realized too late that the plan had failed. Blood spilled in the square, but not the Queen’s. His men were overwhelmed by the women warriors - graceful, precise, and merciless.</p>
The King turned to his wife, shaken.</p>
“You knew this was coming.”</p>
“I warned you,” she said coldly. “But you refused to see the fire under your own roof.”</p>
</p>
That night, Kojo Bempah fled the city with a small band of loyalists, heading toward the dense forests of the Offin River. He hoped to regroup, to rally the outer villages where his influence remained.</p>
But he didn’t make it far.</p>
Queen Akosua dispatched a unit of elite scouts - led by Afia Mensima and two of the Queen’s former bodyguards - to track him. At dawn on the third day, they caught him at a watering hole, drinking from a calabash.</p>
Surrounded, Kojo Bempah didn’t beg. He drew his sword and shouted:</p>
“I am Ashanti! I will not die on my knees!”</p>
Afia stepped forward. “Then you will die as you lived - with ambition, but without honour.”</p>
She struck the final blow.</p>
</p>

The execution of Kojo Bempah sent shockwaves through the kingdom. His body, wrapped in leopard skin as was customary for warriors, was paraded quietly at dawn and buried without rites. No drum beat. No libation. A silence more damning than any decree.</p>
But peace did not return immediately.</p>
Within the royal court, tension lingered like harmattan dust. Some chiefs who once supported Bempah now feigned ignorance, others fawned over the King with sudden loyalty. Yet King Kwarteng knew - loyalty offered in fear was like dry wood: it burned too fast.</p>
Queen Akosua, meanwhile, retreated from public life for several days. Rumors filled Kumasi like smoke: some said she was sick, others that the Queen was communing with spirits. The truth was more complicated.</p>
She was building a case.</p>

In Ashanti tradition, betrayal from within could not go unpunished - not just by sword, but by custom. So Queen Akosua invoked an ancient rite long forgotten: “The Trial of the Stools.” It was a sacred gathering where each divisional chief had to re-declare allegiance by swearing on their own stool - and reveal any knowledge of treason.</p>
The court convened in the shadow of the great Baobab tree near Bantama. The golden stools of every chief were brought forth and cleansed with river water. Drummers played slowly - not the rhythms of war, but of remembrance.</p>
The Queen, veiled in white, spoke before them.</p>
“Our kingdom cannot be ruled by fear, nor by ambition alone. The golden stool is more than power - it is trust.”</p>
She turned to the King.</p>
“Let those who know of treachery speak, or let the ancestors tear the truth from their throats.”</p>
One by one, the chiefs stood, touching their stools and reciting oaths of loyalty. But not all were clean.</p>
Nana Osei Dapaah, the chief of Ejisu, hesitated. Sweat beaded on his brow. He had once accepted gold from Bempah - not to join him, but to remain silent. Now silence became guilt.</p>
“I… I failed the throne. I knew. I said nothing.”</p>
Gasps. The King rose, his jaw tight.</p>
“Do you ask for mercy?”</p>
The old man shook his head. “I ask for justice. I am ready.”</p>
In front of the whole council, Nana Osei Dapaah was stripped of his stool. It was crushed before him - a ritual death. His lands were reassigned to his junior brother.</p>
Justice, swift and symbolic.</p>

After the trials, King Kwarteng began reforms with the Queen’s counsel. Corruption was rooted out. Revenue systems were rebuilt. Trade was restored with the Dagomba and Bono. Even the British, watching carefully from the coast, realized Kumasi was not as divided as they hoped.</p>
But still, shadows lingered. Not all betrayals were visible.</p>
One night, the King sat with the Queen under the moonlight in the royal garden. Fireflies danced around them. He held her hand, heavy with golden rings.</p>
“You saved the throne, Akosua. Not with war - but with wisdom.”</p>
She looked at him, her voice low.</p>
“You’re still King, Kwarteng. But remember this: power must be held with humility, or it will consume even the noble-hearted.”</p>
He nodded slowly.</p>
“And you… you are the drum that warns before the storm. I was foolish to ever silence your rhythm.”</p>
She smiled, but her eyes remained distant.</p>
“The drums never sleep, my King. Even when the palace does.”</p>
In the months that followed, Kumasi entered a period of fragile calm. The scent of rebellion faded from the air, replaced by the aroma of new yam, smoked fish, and shea. Traders returned to the city square, and the drumbeat of Kumasi shifted from suspicion to strength.</p>
But the palace had changed.</p>
The Council of Elders, once bloated with age and flattery, had been trimmed like an overgrown tree. In their place rose a younger generation of advisors, many of whom were former lieutenants of Kojo Bempah—reformed and tested through fire. The King believed in offering redemption to those willing to confess and serve honorably. To rule a kingdom, he’d learned, one must both punish and forgive.</p>
The Queen’s influence grew, though she wore it with quiet grace. She refused any formal title beyond her role as wife and mother of the empire, but everyone knew: Akosua Serwaa was the spine of the golden stool.</p>
Young girls in Kumasi now studied proverbs, not just domestic crafts. The Queen had established a secret circle - Ahenemma Ntoaso, meaning “Daughters of the Stool” - to train future female leaders in diplomacy, healing, and war.</p>
Even Afia Mensima, the once-quiet handmaiden, was now referred to as Ahenni Ba, the King's Daughter by Honor, a title never before given to a non-royal. She had earned it not by blood, but by bravery.</p>
A Kingdom in Reflection</p>
As the next Akwasidae approached, the city prepared again - not for survival, but for celebration. Drums rang with confidence, not caution. Cloth merchants dyed new kente in colors to honor peace: blue for wisdom, green for renewal, and gold for unity.</p>
During the festival, the King stood before the people and raised his staff.</p>
“We have been tested by fire,” he declared. “But the gold remains. Let the world know: Kumasi is not ruled by fear, but by legacy. We do not run from truth. We sit with it, even when it burns.”</p>
The crowd roared, and for the first time in a long while, their cheer was unforced.</p>
Later, under the sacred tree in the palace courtyard, the Queen sat weaving cloth. The King approached and sat beside her, his royal staff leaned gently against the roots.</p>
“What are you weaving?” he asked softly.</p>
She smiled, without looking up.</p>
“A new future. One thread at a time.”</p>
A Whisper from the Ancestors</p>
One night, Queen Akosua dreamed of Yaa Asantewaa. The warrior queen stood before her in full battle regalia, her voice echoing like a horn through time.</p>
“You stood when others bowed. You saw when others slept. Let the stool be guarded not only by warriors, but by watchers.”</p>
The Queen woke with tears on her cheeks. She rose quietly and walked barefoot to the shrine, lighting three candles — one for the past, one for the present, and one for the unborn.</p>
In that moment, she understood something the King was only beginning to grasp:</p>
 The kingdom’s survival would not depend on the strength of swords or the wealth of gold—but on the courage to confront truth, generation after generation.</p>

Years passed. The golden leaves of Kumasi’s sacred trees fell and grew again. Children who had once played in palace courtyards were now messengers, scribes, farmers, and guards. Time, ever steady, marched forward - but the memory of the great betrayal and the trial of justice lived on in the songs of griots and the stories of elders.</p>
Queen Akosua, now older, walked more slowly through the palace grounds, her steps lighter, her voice deeper. She had become a living legend - Obaa a ɔkyerɛ ɔman kwan, meaning “the woman who guided a nation.”</p>
Yet, she never claimed glory. When visitors from distant regions came to hear the tale, she always began the same way:</p>
“It was not I who saved Kumasi. It was truth. And truth wears no crown.”</p>
One evening, as the sun melted behind the hills and turned the palace red and gold, her grandson, a boy of ten, approached her. He carried a small talking drum, carved with the images of lions and eagles.</p>
“Nana,” he said. “Why do the drums never stop during Akwasidae? Even when it’s quiet, I still hear them.”</p>
Queen Akosua smiled. She placed a wrinkled hand on the boy’s chest.</p>
“That is because the real drum is not in the marketplace, or the palace. It is here. It beats for justice. For courage. For our people.”</p>
The boy leaned against her, comforted not just by her warmth but by the rhythm of a people who had endured, adapted, and survived.</p>
“Will I be king one day?” he asked.</p>
She looked at him carefully.</p>
“Only if you remember what we nearly lost. Power is not a gift - it is a burden. You must carry it with clean hands, or not at all.”</p>

                        <h4 class="ul-project-details-infos-title">About The Writer</h4>
                        <p>I am Lawrence Kwabena Sabla, an IT professional and storyteller who finds balance between the structured world of technology and the boundless realm of creative writing. I currently serve as an IT manager, a role that allows me to manage the technical heart of one of the country's leading digital media platforms. My passion for reading and writing is what drives my creativity. I believe that being a writer is much like being a web developer; both require patience, attention to detail, and a commitment to building something meaningful from scratch. My story, “The Trusted Drums of Kumasi,” which placed third in the Simple Script Writers Project 2025, is a reflection of my deep love for our cultural heritage. I was inspired to write this story by a desire to explore the rhythmic history of the Asante Kingdom. I wanted to capture how traditional communication: symbolized by the drums, acted as the heartbeat of a nation’s identity and resistance. By blending historical truth with fiction, I aim to make the stories of our ancestors feel alive for a new generation. For future writers, my advice is simple: Never be afraid to put your thoughts into writing, even if it is a draft. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s only through your words we can understand the beauty of the mind. </p>
