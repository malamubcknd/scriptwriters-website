                        <p class="ul-event-details-descr"> They think I sleep when the rats come out. But sleep is a kindness I no longer deserve. In this place, sleep is treason. You close your eyes, and the past creeps in, bloodied, loud, and full of teeth. The air here is thick. Not just heavy, but wrong. It sticks to your skin like a second layer of filth. The stench is unbearable, yet constant: fermented sweat, rotting food, old blood, and something sour that I can’t name but can never forget. It's the scent of people slowly breaking. The walls are wet. Always wet. The moisture drips down like tears, but the kind no one wipes away. The cracks are my calendar, and the rats my only company. I have forgotten what it feels like to laugh. The cell is a box with no mercy. A slit of a window lets in a thin trickle of light, only enough to remind you of what you're missing. This cell is not a room. It is a grave in waiting.
         <p>Asantewaa is my name, or… it used to be. Before they took it away. Before the day my sky fell and never rose again. I was the only daughter in a family of six, five strong brothers, a mother with a voice like the earth’s hum, and a father whose hands told stories without words. My brothers adored me and protected me with their lives. I was cherished beyond words at home. Even at school, the teachers loved me because I was an excellent student. We lived in a town that sat on the edge of Accra’s shadow, where kiosks and zinc-roofed shops buzzed with gossip, and tailors played loud highlife music from tiny speakers. You could still hear the mosque’s call to prayer in the morning and the cry of a hawker selling roasted groundnuts at dusk. It wasn’t quite a village, but it wasn’t modern either. It was something in between, unfinished, like me. I studied by lantern light, poring over borrowed books and scribbling notes on old papers. I passed my WASSCE with a smile wider than the Volta. But dreams need money to walk, and we had none to spare. So, I folded up my future and tucked it into the thatch of our roof. Then I returned to the land of the red earth that fed us, stained our fingernails, and kept us moving.</p>
        The day everything changed started like any other. We were coming home from the farm; our clothes soaked in sweat, and our mouths dry from the harmattan winds. We walked past neighbours roasting maize by their gates, and children dragging worn slippers through dust. We stopped briefly in the square near the community centre, where the radio was louder than usual. Then the voice came. Sharp. Strange. Commanding. “This is the word of Flight Lieutenant Rawlings. The old order is dead. The people’s revolution has begun. All strong and able-bodied men are to report to their districts. Anyone caught hiding them will face the consequences. No mercy. No delay.” I remember how my mother’s lips stopped moving mid-chew on her roasted maize. My heart slowed. Around us, the town cracked like an egg under pressure, helter-skelter everywhere, whispering, locking doors. The revolution was coming. The air changed. Even the trotro parked near the mechanic's shed fell silent. We didn’t say much on the way home. But we knew. They were coming and wouldn’t wait for an invitation. A week passed. Every sound outside our house felt like a warning. We were all pretending to be normal, but nothing was.</p>
       Then came the day. That faithful morning. I had secretly taken Kwaku's bicycle to the market, trying to hurry. I had hoped to buy Aunty Ekua’s doughnuts before I finished my chores, because by the time I usually finished, she would be out. However, I was careless. The road was broken, and the wheel hit a stone and snapped. I wasn’t hurt, just a scratch on my knee. Most of the damage was to the bike. I panicked and stashed the bike behind the shed. I knew Kwaku would be furious, and he would wake up soon. So, I ran inside and hid in the old closet behind the house. I sat with my knees pulled up to my chest, tucked between faded cloth and old market baskets. I held my breath not out of fear of Kwaku, but because something about the day already felt wrong. Heavy. Then I heard it. The thudding of feet. Screaming in the distance. Shouts. And then</p>
“Maame! Maame Asantewaa!”</p>
It was my mother. She burst through the front door, barefoot and breathless. Her clothes were coming undone. Her face was soaked in sweat and streaked with fear and panic.</p>
“They’re coming!” she shouted, stumbling forward.</p>
 “They’re in the square already. They’re taking the boys. They’re going house to house!”</p>
        My brothers rushed into the main room, still sleepy, still half believing this was a nightmare. My father was behind them, slow to arrive, confusion etched into the corners of his eyes. He didn’t understand what his wife was on about. He just stood there, staring at his wife like she had come home from the grave. The door crashed open. The soldiers entered like thunder. No warning. No words. Just rage in uniforms. The first one stepped forward and, without hesitation, slit my father’s throat. Just like that. No question. No explanation. He fell. His body hit the floor with a thud that I still hear when I close my eyes. Blood gushed from his neck like a waterfall. I had never seen so much blood in my life. My mother collapsed beside him, screaming his name repeatedly like she could bring him back with words.</p>
“K-Kojo! Kojo! Wake up… wake up!”</p>
         My brothers were shouting now. Not in anger but shock, in horror. They tried to move. Tried to reach for her. But the soldiers surrounded them, beat them into the floorboards, and tied their wrists and ankles like cattle. I could hear my brothers grunting, choking on their pain. I could hear the slap of boots on skin. I could hear my mother’s cries stretching until they were just sounds. Then came silence. Before I could make sense of it, they turned to her. Two men grabbed her. She kicked, screamed, cried, and begged, but it didn’t matter. They dragged her into the middle of the room, in our home, and tore her clothes from her body. One by one, they took her. I couldn’t move.  I couldn’t look away. I couldn’t cry. They raped her. Each of them. In our living room. On the floor where I learnt to crawl, I was helpless. Her screams shook the ceiling. She screamed until her voice broke. Then whimpered. Then fell silent. Her body was limp, shaking, bleeding. My brothers were forced to watch, bound, broken, weeping. I saw life leave her eyes. When they were done, they dropped her like a rag. Her eyes were wide open, but they were empty. A broken shell.</p>
             I was still in the closet. Frozen. Cowardly. A statue of salt and shame. One soldier looked down at her, almost bored. He pulled out his knife, small, clean, and bent beside her. I wanted to scream. I wanted to move. I wanted to die before I saw what he did next. But I couldn’t. I couldn’t move a single limb. He slit her throat as easily as someone opening a letter. Then he stood and left. My brothers were dragged out of the house, kicking and sobbing and silent. The soldiers didn’t look back. I stayed in that closet for what felt like years, soaked in urine, shaking in my skin. Heart screaming and soul shattering. I didn’t cry. I didn’t move. I just listened to the echo of my mother’s final breath, trapped between blood and memory as she whispered my name.</p>
          I don’t remember how long I stayed in the closet, but it was long enough for my limbs to forget they belonged to me. When I finally stepped out, the house was still. Still, but not silent. I could hear the way the air moved. The town was so quiet. A part of me hoped with all my heart that it was a dream. That I would open my eyes and hear Kwahu cursing about his bicycle, that I would open my eyes, and my mother would be screaming at me for not finishing my chores. I was rudely brought back to reality with the heavy stench of blood in the room. I fell by the lifeless bodies of my parents. They both still had their eyes open. When I stepped out of the closet, the air had changed.</p>

The blood had dried. The house, still. But something in me had split like a gourd cracked down the middle. I no longer moved like a girl. I moved like an echo. A memory. Something left behind. It was Aku who found me. My mother’s closest friend. She lived two compounds away, in the house with the blue door. Just took my hand and led me away. I was still. I was numb. That night, we buried my parents in the backyard. The soil behind Aku’s house was soft and still smelled of last season’s maize. We dug two graves side by side, wrapped their bodies in white, and placed stones at their heads. No priest. No crowd. Just me, Aku, and the wind. The bodies were heavy, and I never expected to lose my parents this way, but still, no tears fell. I didn’t say goodbye. I didn’t even pray. Because what prayer do you offer to a God who looked away?</p>
       Living with Aku felt like drowning with your eyes open. She gave me a room of my own. A narrow bed, a faded mosquito net, a small window with iron bars. She cooked for me, spoke gently, and never pushed. But grief doesn’t respond to kindness. It lingers. It hides in the soft things. I tried to help her around the house. Tried to sweep, fetch water, and grind pepper. But my hands shook when I picked up a knife. I couldn’t bear the sound of slamming doors. Couldn’t look anyone in the eye. At night, I didn’t sleep. I saw my mother’s face. My father’s throat. The soldiers. The blood. Every time I closed my eyes, it happened again. And again. I started scratching my arms until they bled, just to feel something else. But Aku saw me. Not just the girl I was, but the one I might still become. She started giving me small things to do. Little seeds of purpose. Fix the hem on her wrapper. Peel the yam for dinner. Read from the Bible, even when I just mouthed the words. She told me stories about my mother. How she used to sing in the rain. How she once climbed a palm tree just to prove my father wrong. How brave she was. All the adventures before I was born, and with each story, I felt my heart slowly start to beat life into me. It was refreshing. I had grieved for so long that I had forgotten how it felt to laugh. At first, I didn’t believe her. I couldn’t match that woman with the broken body I had seen. But slowly, the stories stitched themselves into me. My mother was a lot braver than I thought she was, and I was proud of her.</p>
     I began to write. First, on old newspapers. Then, in a little notebook Aku gave me from her days as a seamstress’s apprentice. I wrote letters I would never send. Wrote names I would never forget. Wrote pain I couldn’t say out loud. Those pages felt like an escape from my bitter reality. For the first time in forever, I felt I could control everything. And through it all, I began to imagine something dangerous. A future. It wasn’t sudden. Healing never is, but one morning, almost a year to the day after my sky fell, I woke up before the sun. I stepped outside. The air was wet with dew. I stood before the graves. I hadn’t been back here since the burial. I ran my fingers across the stone, and I whispered something. Not a goodbye.</p>
Just: “I’m going now.”</p>
I felt a gust of wind across my body. It was as if they were giving me their blessing to move on in life. I packed my things. Aku had bought me a small grey suitcase when I told her about my plans. She was ecstatic about my decision. Aku didn’t ask where I was going. She only held me for a long time and slipped a few cedis into my palm.</p>
“I knew your mother,” she said softly. “And I know you. You have so much more to offer.”</p>
     The lorry to Accra was loud and full of sweating bodies. I sat by the window, watching the trees lean and pass. I didn’t cry when we pulled out of town. I didn’t flinch when a soldier passed at the checkpoint. I was no longer a ghost. My escape from reality through a pencil was short-lived, as I heard a clang. The sound cut through my memories like a blade, my life before the storm faded, and once again, I was faced by damp walls. A rusted door. The same stain in the corner that I had stopped trying to clean with my spit and fingernails. I didn’t look at the food; there was no need. I already knew what it was. The heat had long died from the beans. The soup, if you could call it that, had separated into sludge and grease. I picked up the corner of the tin plate, stared at it, and wondered what was more dangerous: the hunger or the taste. I set it down again. There was no desire left in me, not for food, not for hope, not for anything. I had fought. I had survived. I had spoken when silence would have been easier. And still, here I was. In chains. Broken again. </p>
      Outside these walls, Ghana bled slowly. The memory of May 16th, 1979, still cast its long shadow across the land. The Rawlings regime, baptized in the name of justice, had become a gospel of fear. Soldiers patrolled dusty roads with rifles too long for their shoulders. Names disappeared from registers. Voices disappeared from the radio. They called it “housecleaning.” But it wasn’t dirt they were scrubbing. It was dissent. Poverty and famine like never been seen before. It was hideous. Women on the street crying, begging for food to feed their dying children. Collarbones became so hollow that they could carry water. Rawlings’ chain, they called it. In Makola, women were stripped and lashed for selling above the price control. The regime claimed it was the will of the people.   But if the people ever had a voice, it had been drowned in the flood of fear. Justices who stood up to the regime were stripped of their lives, and their bodies were found half burnt at the Bundase camp. And the boots kept marching.</p>
     A slip of paper found its way into my cell, folded tight and pushed through the smallest crack where light used to visit. I didn’t have to guess. It was from Kwabena, the only soldier here who still remembered how to be human. No words. Just space. And that was enough. I reached beneath my mattress, fingers fumbling for the stub of a pencil I’d hidden weeks ago. It had been sharpened against the wall so many times that it was barely longer than my thumb. Still, it would do. I wiped my hands on my skirt, smoothed the paper against my thigh, and began to write again. </p>
   "Accra met me like a slap. The air was hot, the people were loud, and the city didn’t care that I came carrying the bones of my parents in my chest. It didn’t care that I had seen my brothers bound like animals. It didn’t ask me who I was. And maybe that’s why I survived it. Because for the first time, I was just a girl. No story. No blood. No past. I stayed with my mother’s cousin in a compound house near Nima. She didn’t have much, but she gave me space to sleep, and food when there was enough. I sold sachet water during the day. On good days, I scrubbed the floors at a chop bar in New Town.  At night, I wrote. Not for beauty. Not for peace. Just to keep the screaming quiet."  I had been in this cold town for a few years when I found them by accident. A gathering of strange people in a half-burnt classroom. At first, I thought they were just talking about food shortages, soldiers, and ration cards. But then I heard one woman say:</p>
'They took my daughter in ’82. She was only twelve,' she said as a tear rolled down her cheek.</p>
The room fell silent. That silence felt like home. We called ourselves nothing at first. But we came back, week after week, pulled by grief and something harder, something like fury. They came from all corners: a former teacher whose brother was executed without trial. A fisherman who hadn’t seen his wife since the military raided their village. A girl who had only ever known her mother’s name from a burnt letter. We remembered. And then we began to speak. We didn’t have guns. We didn’t wear uniforms. But our stories had power. I found my voice in that room. And when I spoke, I saw it in their eyes that spark. That trembling thing that says, "I thought I was the only one." "We became more than a room. We became a movement. We wrote pamphlets. Each piece of paper tells our story. We smuggled testimonies into student circles protesting the Almighty regime. We rallied the people. We moved to different towns to strengthen our numbers, all while the regime had gotten wind of our activities, and they were not happy.</p>
     One night, I stood in the middle of a square in Osu and read my story aloud. “I am a victim of this regime, of how cruel and merciless they are. I watched them kill my parents in cold blood and take my brothers from me. They took my life, my family, my home, but they will never take my voice.” I shouted at the top of my lungs. The crowd at Osu had soldiers among them, and they arrested me the next morning. I didn’t flinch. Not when they slapped me. Not when they dragged me through the barracks with a bag over my head. Because by then, I had already made peace with this truth: They could chain my hands, but not my words. Not my voice. Once the bag was taken off, I saw a few of the people in the movement, bound and in tears. I was thrown into a cell, and my execution was ordered. I was given ten days, and today is day eight. I folded the paper carefully and slid it back under the bed, placing it beside the other papers.</p>
     I didn’t touch the food. I sat against the wall, arms folded, eyes closed and whispered the names of everyone who had ever stood with me. With each name came a wonderful memory. Then I whispered the names of the dead. I saw my mother. She touched my face and whispered that she was proud of me. Of the strong girl I had become. An unwelcome tear dropped, and I had no energy to wipe it off, so I let it flow. Then I whispered mine.</p>
Asantewaa.</p>
And even in this darkness, even in this rotting, forgotten place, my name still tasted like fire. It was unfortunate that this fire was about to go out. I closed my eyes and called it a night. </p>
   I was awoken by screams the next morning. It was one of the girls in the resistance. Her day of death had come. She fought with all her might. I wondered where she even got the energy from. She screamed and cried and begged, and within a few minutes, she disappeared from my eyes. I fell on the floor by the plate of food I had left the day before. The nice guard came back and made a gesture at me. I figured he wanted the plate back. I gave it to him, and our eyes met for the first time since I have been here. For the first time, I felt warmth, just from looking into his eyes. He grabbed the plate and wandered off. I looked under the bed where I had hidden the pieces of paper. Over eight days, I had written my life on these papers, my story, my truth, my life. In less than forty-eight hours, I was to die. How wonderful! I brought them out and held each one close to my chest. I sighed. So, was this the end? Is this the way I lose my voice, by the same hands that took my life? No, if I were going to die, I would do it on my terms, my way. I lay facing the ceiling, the light peeped from the cracks in the wall. I’m sure this was not the fate Aku wanted for me when she sent me here. You could hear screams from outside, people crying as bodies dropped to the floor. Some soldiers laughed as they passed by our cells. Mimicking the cries of those being executed. I felt disgusted. Did these people have no heart?</p>
      Kwabena came in with lunch, or what passes for it here. The first meal of the day. A sludgy mess of maize and something I couldn’t name. I didn’t care for it anymore. But I cared for him. Not because he was kind. But because he was quiet. And quiet, in this place, is rare. As he slid the tin bowl into the cell, I didn’t reach for it. I reached for his hand. He froze. Startled. Maybe afraid. But I didn’t let go.</p>
"Please," I whispered, voice brittle as dry leaves. "Please… when I’m gone, take the papers."</p>
He followed my eyes as I pointed to the space under my bed, the little collection of scraps I’d written on, smuggled in, one piece at a time.</p>
“Tell them,” I said, barely getting the words out, “tell someone I was here. That I lived. That they took everything from me.” His jaw clenched. He looked away. “I’m begging you, Kwabena.” He nodded, slowly. Almost like a bow. I think he understood more than he let on. But I wasn’t done. I tightened my grip. “One more thing.” He looked back at me. I don’t know what he saw in my eyes, maybe the truth, maybe the end, but he didn’t pull away. </p>
“I need a knife.”</p>
He stepped back immediately, shaking his head. “No… no, I can’t”. “Tomorrow is the day,” I interrupted. “First light.” He blinked. It was the first time I’d seen him speak with his whole face. Not just with glances and silences. “You don’t ......have to do this... you can....,” his eyes flickering, stepping closer again. I looked at him, “But you know I will.” A beat of silence passed between us, heavy as chains. I smiled. It was small, weak, but it was there.</p>
 “There’s no running from this, Kwabena. Not here. Not in this country. I’ve seen too much to believe in escape.” He looked at me like he was carrying something heavy in his chest. Regret, maybe. Or shame. Maybe both. “I’m going to die,” I said quietly. “At least let me do it with dignity.” He was still for a long time. Then, finally, he nodded. Just once. I didn’t say thank you. I just looked at him. Let my eyes do what words no longer could. And then he left slower than usual. But I knew he’d be back. </p>
With what I asked for.</p>
With my ending.</p>
With my freedom.</p>

The air was still. As if the walls themselves were holding their breath. It was almost dusk when Kwabena returned. He didn’t speak. Not at first. He stood by the door, the way he always did, but something about his presence was different. Heavy. Final. He knelt and slid something through the tiny hatch; something wrapped carefully in cloth. I didn’t unwrap it immediately. I looked at him, my fingers trembling. His eyes met mine for the first time in days, and this time, he didn’t look away.</p>
  “There’s paper inside,” he murmured. His voice was soft, hoarse, like it hadn’t been used in years. “And a pen. Thought you’d… want to say goodbye. Your way.” My breath caught. I nodded, but the tears came anyway. Quiet ones. The kind that burned, not because of sadness, but because of release. Then he paused, uncertain. He glanced at the walls, then leaned in slightly. “The knife… It’s beneath the cloth.” I reached through the hatch and squeezed his hand. “Thank you,” I said. The words barely passed my lips. He looked at me, truly looked, then gave a small bow, not military, not protocol. Something gentler. Almost reverent. And then he was gone. I sat cross-legged on the cold concrete floor, placing the bundle in front of me like a sacred offering. Carefully, I unwrapped it. The knife glinted once, then stilled, a slender, sharp salvation. Beside it, two sheets of paper and a blue pen, the ink slightly faded. I took the pen first. Let it rest between my fingers. My last companion. Then I began to write:</p>
To the ones who loved me, and to the ones who will never know I lived…</p>
I was a daughter. A sister. A girl who once believed her life would be filled with books and laughter and the sound of ripe plantains sizzling in palm oil. I was born Asantewaa in a town that lived between dust and hope. They took everything from me. My father’s voice. My mother’s laughter. My brothers' songs. They took the sun from my sky and the ground from under my feet. But they did not take my voice. Not entirely. If you are reading this, then know I lived. I remembered. I wrote it down. So that one day, when Ghana has healed, truly healed, someone will find my words and say, “This is what they did. This is why we never forget.” I have no more strength left to fight in flesh, but in ink, I leave a war cry. Do not let them silence you. Not the men in boots. Not the ones in office chairs with blood on their hands and smiles on their faces. If you have survived, rise. If you have fallen, write. If you have nothing left to say. Even with trembling lips. Even with shaking hands. This country is worth saving. And so are you. Remember me not for how I died. But for how I dared to speak.</p>
Farewell.</p>
Asantewaa.
I folded the letter and kissed it once. My hand found the knife. And in the silence of that prison, in the shadow of a broken nation, I whispered my parents' name and sat up against the wall. It was light. Too light for what it carried. I held it like a secret, like something sacred. My palms were steady now, no more trembling. No more fear. Only the strange, aching quiet of clarity. I sat back, my spine resting against the cold wall, the blade glinting softly in the dim shaft of moonlight that had slipped in through the cracks above. Outside, the world had settled into its cruel rhythm. Somewhere beyond these walls, soldiers marched. Families whispered in fear. A mother rocked a child who would never know peace. The night air carried the sharp tang of smoke, like the country itself was burning from the inside out. But here… in this small, forgotten cell… it was still. I closed my eyes.</p>
    I saw my mother’s hands firm, calloused, kind. I saw her, braiding my hair, holding my face, the night before the world ended. I saw my father’s shoulders as he walked ahead of me through the fields, humming songs that only made sense in sunlight. And I heard them now. Not the memory of them, no, but something deeper. Something alive. Their voices, gentle and warm, calling me across the distance.</p>
“Asantewaa.”</p>
I exhaled. Then, for a while, there was only silence. No screams. No footsteps. Just the hush of breath and blade and memory. First light finally came.</p>
And then,</p>
A clang.</p>
Metal. Keys. Footsteps, fast and frantic. Voices muffled behind doors. Screams.</p>
And when the guards opened the cell, what they found or didn’t find was never spoken of in full. Some say I was slumped against the wall, eyes closed, as if I had finally fallen asleep. Some say the blade was untouched, others say there was so much blood.</p>
 I guess we’ll never know.</p>

                        <p>I am Hilda Akosua Konadu Karikari, a Law student of Presbytery University Ghana. I came about this contest through a friend and the theme stood out to me. This was my first time writing in a Ghanaian setting and it was challenging to say the least. I almost didn't write it because it was outside my comfort zone. Now I am glad I took up the challenge. Fire in my name was inspired by my mum who the main character is named after. Her perseverance and determination in life gave me the tools I needed to develop the character in this story. The rest came from my love of history and the individual experiences faced by the people who lived through that era. I encourage future writers not to shy away from daunting themes but to embrace them. If you attempt it, you might like the challenge and find it easier than expected. I most certainly enjoyed it.</p>
