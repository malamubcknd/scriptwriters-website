                        <h2 class="ul-event-details-title">Echoes of Chalk and Dreams: Life in Ghana’s Senior High Schools (2nd Winner)</h2>
                        <p class="ul-event-details-descr"> There is a certain poetry to school life, the ringing of the morning bell, the scraping of sandals on dusty floors, the chaotic rhythm of classrooms buzzing with youthful energy. In Ghana, this poetry reaches its most intense and unforgettable stanzas in senior high school. It is more than just an academic phase; it is indeed a rite of passage. Within the four walls of classrooms and the wide-open spaces of dining halls and dormitories, Ghanaian teenagers undergo a transformation that shapes their identity, values, and lifelong aspirations. </p>
For many students, senior high school (SHS) represents both freedom and responsibility. It is a melting pot of laughter and pressure, of friendship and competition, of youthful rebellion and emerging discipline. From Form One(1) to Form Three(3), school life becomes a journey filled with defining moments — late-night studies with flashlights, house chores under strict housemasters, spirited inter-school debates, and heated football rivalries that bind students together like family. This essay dives into the heartbeat of SHS life in Ghana; not from the viewpoint of policies and statistics, but through the eyes of the students who live it. It is a tale of chalkboards, sleepless nights, smuggled phones, and lifelong bonds. Welcome to the world where dreams are shaped — one school bell at a time. </p>
The journey begins with the first step through the school gates. For most first-year students, known as </p>
“Freshers” or “form one boys/girls,” that first day is a cocktail party of excitement accompanied with fear and anxiety. Parents wave tearful goodbyes, trunks and chop boxes are dragged to dormitories, and the reality of boarding life begins to settle. Senior students, usually eager to assert their authority, begin to assign chores, sometimes harmless, other times exaggerated to ensure students have a feel of life in school. It’s not hazing in the Western sense, but a cultural induction of sorts. Learning how to sweep well or polish shoes with a banana peel to shine as gold suddenly becomes a life lesson. The fear of seniors fades as bonds grow and routines become second nature. That is when people find school parents; school mum and dad strengthening bonds between senior students and “Freshers,” we call it. The first day teaches a memorable and unforgettable lesson in SHS—adjustment and adaptability are the two key things you must know. One must quickly learn how to survive with limited water, make friends fast, and memorize the names of all friends, classmates, and most importantly dining hall prefects in order to abscond the risk of going hungry. </p>
That initiation phase is only the beginning of an evolving story. Within the first few weeks, freshers are already mimicking senior lingo, learning songs that are sung at morning assemblies, and adapting to the communal lifestyle. Dorm life, though chaotic, teaches shared responsibility. Imagine twenty students in one room, each bringing their own personality, background, and habits. Some snore, others hum in their sleep, and there’s always that one student who wakes everyone up with an early devotional hymn. It is a life of compromise and learning how to coexist with others from different regions, ethnicities, and belief systems. You realize quickly that school is a microcosm of Ghana itself — rich in diversity and united by purpose. </p>
The classroom is the heart of every SHS, and academic work is no joke. Ghanaian students are not strangers when it comes to high academic expectations, especially with the pressure to perform well in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). Classes often begin as early as 7:00 AM and extend into prep sessions that end at 9:00 PM. Students are given at least two break times, with which one is used for breaking the usual night fast and the other for lunch before school closes. Normally, evening preps start at 7:00 PM where assignments, research, and personal studies are done to ensure a prepared mind for the next day. Teachers are both mentors and disciplinarians. Some inspire students with real passion; quoting Shakespeare with flair, solving calculus like poetry, or turning Biology into a storytelling session where different mnemonics like “My Very Eyes May Just See Under Nine Planets,” a very popular mnemonic for memorizing the nine planets in the solar system. </p>
Others are feared more than loved, due to their sharp demoralizing words and even sharper canes. Students often dread these teachers' classes but later realize that their strictness comes from a desire to see them succeed. </p>
There’s also the phenomenon of group studies, where “sharks” lead others in discussing difficult topics, or </p>
when notes from other schools are smuggled and photocopied because they’re “better explained.” These moments of teamwork in the face of academic pressure create a powerful sense of community. Exams and tests are stressful, but they also push students to develop strong study habits and mental endurance. Late-night learning under torchlight becomes the norm, especially during revision week. </p>
But amidst the pressure, students develop values such as discipline. They learn the art of time management, study techniques like “group studies and presentations,” studying under mango trees, and developing a deep interest in some subjects. It’s very common to find students arguing over math problems after lights out, whispering equations under mosquito nets and being punished by dormitory captains for making noise. If academics form the spine of SHS, social life is the soul. The friendships formed in SHS often last a lifetime. From shared meals of Gari soakings to group punishments like weeding overgrown grass, students find common ground to learn, admire, and grow into each other’s lives. </p>
Clans naturally form: the “bookworms” students, the athletes, the “front seaters” in church and social gatherings, the debaters, the choristers, the “sharks,” the drama kings and queens, and of course, the “bunk lords” who always seem to have extra provisions hidden in their trunks that you may never know unless you are a very close friend indeed. There’s also a unique school culture in every SHS being the school anthems, morning assemblies, chants during inter-house sports, and slang only insiders understand, songs some departments can only sing, and many others. Each school has its pride, its rivalries, and its traditions as well. Whether you’re from Breman Asikuma Senior High School, Legon Presec, Wesley Girls, Opoku Ware, or Holy Child, you carry a badge of identity that no one can take from you. This badge makes you different when schools come together to strengthen ties. </p>
Ask any SHS student in Ghana what they remember most, and food that was served in their dining halls will definitely be the first idea to pop up. Not necessarily for its taste, but for the awesome memories it carries. </p>
Meals in the dining hall is an adventure. From the occasional “concrete kenkey” to the legendary watery light soup they call it, students learn the true meaning of adaptation, humility and admiration. That’s where gari soaking: a mix of gari, sugar, milk (if lucky), groundnuts, and water from the borehole, becomes both an expensive snack and a savior. It’s not just food but a culture as well. The dining hall also doubles as a comedy theatre where most jokes and gags are created. Students create nicknames for some special foods, impersonate teachers, and sneak in biscuits hidden in socks. Mealtime is when friends bond, secrets are shared, and school politics is discussed over spoons and laughter. </p>
There’s also the matter of dining hall seating arrangements — where you sit can say a lot about who you are. New students learn to find good spots quickly or risk eating under the watchful eye of a hungry prefect. Some students develop stealthy tactics to secure a second serving, especially on Sundays when rice and stew is in rotation. Despite the simplicity of the meals, the conversations and laughter shared around food form some of the most memorable moments in a student’s life. </p>
Every Ghanaian SHS has a house system for easy recognition and speedy assistance. Students are divided into houses; usually named after historical figures, virtues, and most times, founders of the school. These houses compete in every activity worth to be called competitions, from sports to sanitation, and loyalty runs deep. Discipline and time consciousness are the cornerstone of life in senior high school. Prefects are given real authority; some use it well, others abuse it. Housemasters and mistresses together with the management of the school help maintain law and order, by often using simple and creative punishments such as scrubbing bathrooms, writing lines, or “picking stones” under the sun and more. While some rules feel strict or outdated, they instill a sense of respect, order, and personal responsibility in students. Students may moan about these strict rules, but years later, they laugh about it, and often admit it helped them become better and very responsible adults. </p>
Despite the strict routines and ordeals, SHS isn’t all work. There’s an avenue for releasing course work stress and refreshing minds. Saturday night entertainment shows, school drama performances, and inter-house spelling bee and inter-school quiz competitions bring joy and relief. Debate teams battle it out with verve and passion. Sports teams carry the hopes of entire schools during Super Zonals Sports Competitions. Entertainment nights are where most students are granted the opportunity to showcase their hidden talents to the entire school, from rap battles to cultural dances. This is where the bookworms are penalized for being absent for social gatherings only to realize they were studying during the course of entertainment shows. </p>
And of course, there’s always that one school actor who mimics the headmaster or the headmistress too well than everyone can do. Music plays a big role in SHS life. Dormitories echo with Azonto beats or soft gospel music such as “Aseda Nuom,” my favourite among the lots, during evening devotions. Some students form music groups for the school or learn how to play instruments in the school’s church. Not to forget this school instrumentalist are mostly those you see with girls but may end up advising you in a way as if they know about the second coming of Jesus Christ. Others find solace in writing lyrics or sketching in their notebooks; tiny acts of rebellion or self-expression. </p>
Even in a disciplined environment, emotions blossom. Teenage years in school are a time of self-discovery, and SHS life introduces students to feelings of attraction, heartbreak, and admiration. From anonymous love letters to nervous smiles during entertainment nights, SHS is where many experience their first crush and where most people make their first proposals. Despite the fact that the official school rules often discourage romantic relationships, the feelings are real. Whispered conversations during break time, coded nicknames, and innocent notes slipped secretly under doors. </p>
These moments may seem trivial, but they play a huge role in shaping the emotional maturity of students. Students learn how to navigate feelings, respect boundaries, and deal with rejection and stigmatization; life lessons are just as important as anything learned in class. By the time students reach Form Three, their final year in school, they have become the seniors they once feared. Uniforms fit differently, academic responsibilities increase while house work decreases, and the countdown to the West African Senior School Certificate Examination commonly known as WASSCE begins. </p>
Final-year students juggle preparation with homesickness. This tension created brings back the minds of the unserious, forcing them to study thoroughly. This is the only time where the school dancer will sit by his book for about three (3) hours or even more. This is the time every moment feels like the last where you would hear people say today might be our; “last visiting day,” “our last roll call,” “our last joke under the tree behind the dining hall.” People start to think about life after Senior High School at this very moment. WASSCE emerges like a storm cloud, but so does the excitement of life beyond SHS. There’s a maturity in final-year students, a certain pride in how far they’ve come. When the final bell of school completion rings, tears fall; not because they failed, but because they’re saying goodbye to a life teacher that inculcated into them the best values of life and a world that made them who they are. </p>
Senior high school in Ghana is more than just a stepping stone to university. It is a world of its own, full of life-learnt lessons, struggles, laughter, identity, and growth. It’s where students learn how to think critically, build friendships, endure challenges, adapt to environmental changes, and chase dreams. Long after the uniforms are folded away and the school compound becomes a memory, the lessons of SHS forever remain. They echo in job interviews, in acts of kindness, in personal strength, and in sentimental stories told years later. School life, especially in Ghana’s senior high schools, is not just about books or grades. It is about the journey of becoming someone in the future, one morning bell, one prep session, one friend, and one memory at a time. </p>

                        <p>I am Justice Owusu. I'm an eighteen year old (18) Ghanaian with the passion of telling stories that reflect real-life experiences, growth and emotions. My writing is inspired by everyday moments and familiar environments.</p>
I started my Basic Education at Ave Maria Preparatory School where life as a student began. I became the compound overseer of the school due to my dedication for cleanliness. I was very committed and hence was loved by all. After completing, I gained admission to study general science at Breman Asikuma Senior High School abbreviated as BASS. I dedicated most of my time to studies and religion. I later became the Boys' Academic Prefect of the school. Due to my dedication to religious activities in the school, I was appointed as the denominational president for the Non-Methodist Denomination ( A joint denominational session for all students who were neither methodists nor Muslims) of my school. Aside from all these achievements, I had the opportunity to join the National Science and Maths Quiz Team of my school. My achievement inspired many and I became the role model of some pupils before completing the school. </p>
My greatest inspiration was centered on the strong desire I had to create scenes and put them into writing.</p>
An advice I have for upcoming writers is that: never should they limit themselves to imaginations only but rather try. As one of my favourite quotes says; "A task remains practically impossible until it is done". Dear upcoming writers, be eager to do what is seen to be impossible.</p>
