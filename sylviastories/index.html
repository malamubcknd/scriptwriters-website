                        <p class="ul-event-details-descr"> 
It was a serene, airy dusk. Supper was quite fulfilling. It was “fufu ne abenkwan”, a traditional Ghanaian dish made from pounding together boiled cassava and plantain, which I ate with palm nut soup, prepared with crabs, snails, roasted beef, dry herrings, and love. I sat right on our veranda after the heavy meal in the company of my grandparents and my cousin, Osaa. Adjacent to where we sat, there stood an ancient palm tree, diligent and longer-lived than anyone could remember, waving its leaves without resistance in the direction of the wind. According to my grandfather, the tree had been there before he built the house twenty-nine years ago, and he had made it clear to the workers that it should remain untouched.</p>
It was an ordinary Saturday, or so it seemed, and Osaa, who was about to graduate from high school, had come to spend the weekend with us. She sat on a bench that was intentionally placed there, especially for visitors who couldn’t enter our living room. Our grandparents, Mr and Mrs Donkor, soon joined in on our discussions and started sharing their experiences and stories- stories we had already heard a million times over.</p>
We talked about several things: school, politics, church, and the poor educational system in the country. I was only confident to speak on such touchy subjects when I was with family. On a regular day, talking about these issues with the ordinary Ghanaian may result in losing your two front teeth, especially if you do not agree with their opinions.  As we talked, Osaa played some old highlife music from her Samsung phone, “gifted” to her by my aunt, who had bought a new iPhone 11.  Some of the artists were dead, yet we enjoyed the nostalgic tunes, humming along and tapping our feet as we talked about personal experiences regarding the songs as they shuffled one after the other. We shared where and how we heard each song, and the reasons why we liked or did not like it. Mr Donkor particularly did not appreciate music that had hints of profanity in it, as he believed it was one of the major reasons why our generation seemed to be corrupted. My grandmother, on the other hand, was indifferent to such matters. The evening was remarkable for me, as we didn’t get to do this often as a family, knowing how the busyness of life can stretch people far apart from those they love.</p>
Our grandfather, whom we affectionately called Old Boy occasionally, moved from the topics of music and started sharing our childhood stories. This, he started with Osaa. Some I couldn’t believe, and others, no matter how many times I have been told, still embarrassed me. I did not like the fact that my childhood was being mocked. However, I laughed at Osaa too, so when it was my turn, I endured it silently. The music continued, and at some point, we were no longer attentive as we were deeply engrossed in our conversations until a piece of South African music began to play. I remembered that song. We all did. We could all relate to it. It was like a second Ghana anthem. Every child, every adult, every male, every female, every boy, every girl, every Christian, every Muslim, every idol worshipper knew the beat, tune, and rhythm...well, except for the lyrics, but who cared? All we knew was that it made us feel powerful and proud as Africans, more like a patriotic song. Everybody had some form of appreciation for it.  It seemed that this music broke down the barriers of gender, ethnicity, religion, and anything that tends to pit Africans against one another. It was so because you could meet people of different religions and ethnicities, who on a normal day did not see eye to eye, dancing to the rhythm of this song.</p>
“Umqombothi”, my grandmother said, smiling.</p>
 “What's that?” I asked with a curious face and leaned towards her to listen again, as the word sounded gibberish in my ears.</p>
“That is the title of the song Osaa is playing”, she continued. Osaa and I looked at each other in surprise. We did not expect my grandmother, of all people, to know the title of such a song. We looked at my grandfather, expecting him to say something in her defence as he knew we had turned into doubting Thomases.</p>
 "Umqombothi means beer," she began explaining, her voice filled with enthusiasm as she sensed our nosiness. "You know this song has been in existence for thirty-six years- older than you both”, she stretched her wrinkly index finger towards Osaa and me “, and it is about beer”.</p>
 I could neither hold my laughter nor hide my startled countenance. As old as I was, I thought that song was a song about freedom, from colonisation, from betrayal and from the apartheid that bedevilled the nation of South Africa from the 1940s through to the 1990s.</p>
 She continued as though she had read my thoughts,</p>
“Well, though many think it is a song of freedom, the lyrics only describe the process of making a special beer, exclusive to South Africans. It’s quite an important part of South African culture and tradition. It's made from fermented maize and sorghum and is usually served during weddings and other special occasions. We make the same here, you know it already, and we call it pitoo," she concluded in a whispering tone and with a mischievous look.</p>
She went on to recount her personal experience with the song, sharing how she first heard it during her time at Teacher Training College. As a first-year student, she and her classmates had to perform several activities during their first week as freshers, including a choreography night.</p>
 “There were about twelve groups, and my group was the fifth. We all performed with Umqombothi as the song of choice for our year group and spent hours rehearsing the drama and dance routine to match the lyrics and rhythm of the song. I played the character of the woman making the beer.”</p>
	She continued as we were still silent, though I was busily checking out the artist already.</p>
 “Do not change your mind about what and how you feel about this music because you are right. The lyrics may talk about firewood, water, and beer, but it is always about the spirit and passion behind every piece of music, and this one comes with a sense of togetherness, belonging and pride in African ancestry.  Umqombothi encapsulates the vibrant culture of the South African people, and its significance extends beyond just being a popular tune. It represents the traditions and values that have been passed down from generation to generation.”</p>
She coughed slightly and requested water. Osaa and I stood up simultaneously to get it for her. Osaa took the lead and smiled. I sat back on the bench.</p>
“This song holds a special place in my heart because it took a lot of sacrifices for me to get into college, you know that story already, so I will not go into all that…”</p>
   	I laughed in response. “But it was like a victory song to me. Every time I hear it, I remember that choreography dance on that night, and maybe, just maybe, that was how your grandfather took notice of me.”</p>
“What?! You two met in college?”</p>
“College?” Osaa repeated my question as she came out of the kitchen with the glass of water.</p>
“That is a story for another day, girls.”</p>
 She winked and smiled at the husband of her youth. He smiled back. A naughty smile. We knew we were not going to hear that part of the story anytime soon.  Her eyes became teary as she looked up to the sky. Tears of gratitude, perhaps. Night had taken over the day completely now, and mosquitoes were beginning to sing songs to register their unwanted presence.</p>
