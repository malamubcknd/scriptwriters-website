                        <h2 class="ul-event-details-title">The Trusted Drums Of Kumasi (3rd Winner)</h2>

                        <p class="ul-event-details-descr"> The sun rose slowly over Kumasi, its golden rays filtering through thick groves of palm and cocoa trees. The smell of earth, firewood, and early-morning shea butter clung to the wind. In the distance, the sacred Fontomfrom drums echoed across the royal courtyard - not in rhythm for celebration, but for counsel. Trouble was brewing in the heart of the Ashanti Empire.</p>
At the center of the palace grounds stood the Aban Adwa, the Council Hall, carved from the richest Odum wood and adorned with golden stools and the ivory tusks of fallen elephants. Within its cool interior sat King Kwarteng Agyemang, the Asantehene of Kumasi - tall, dark, and crowned in kente, but with eyes troubled by shadows. He was no weakling; he had led warriors to battle against the Dagomba and resisted British overtures with clever diplomacy. But this - this was different.</p>
Whispers of rebellion had slithered through the palace like a viper. There had been theft in the royal treasury, unusual gatherings of young men in the market square at night, and most disturbing of all, a missing golden stool from a minor village chiefdom - a symbol of allegiance and power.</p>
Beside the King stood Queen Akosua Serwaa, a woman of fierce beauty and fiercer mind. Born of royal blood from Akyem Abuakwa, her wisdom was sought even by men who once scoffed at women in politics. She had warned the King months ago about unrest, but he had been blinded by loyalty - particularly to one man.</p>
That man - Kojo Bempah, Commander of the Royal Guard - once saved the King’s life in a surprise ambush near Techiman. But now, tongues wagged that Bempah was plotting his own destiny, dreaming not just of command, but of the throne itself.</p>
As the council assembled that morning, war drums from the east signaled something grave. A messenger, breathless and bleeding, stumbled into the hall and fell to his knees before the King.</p>
“Nana... the Adontenhene has been assassinated. Poisoned. In his own courtyard.”</p>
Gasps filled the hall.</p>
The King’s grip tightened on the arm of his golden stool. The Adontenhene - leader of the vanguard warriors - had supported the King’s reforms to curb corruption among the inner chiefs. His death was no coincidence. It was a warning.</p>
“Who dares defile our kingdom with blood and treachery?” the King bellowed.</p>
But in the silence that followed, his eyes drifted to Kojo Bempah - stoic, loyal, and yet unreadable.</p>
The Queen narrowed her gaze too. She knew war was coming, but it might not be fought on the battlefield. It would be waged in whispers, alliances, betrayals - and only the most cunning would survive.</p>
In the Ashanti Empire, the throne did not only belong to the strongest. It belonged to the most patient.</p>
 In the weeks that followed the Adontenhene’s death, the palace of Kumasi became a maze of uncertainty. At dawn, the market women still sang, and children still played around the palace walls. </p>
But beneath the cheerful chatter, fear simmered. Spies moved like spirits through the streets; loyalty became a question whispered in backrooms. The city wore its silence like a mask.</p>
King Kwarteng summoned the Council of Elders, a rare move outside of annual customs. They arrived in full regalia - some bare-chested, others adorned in animal skins, with gold rings and ivory bracelets gleaming under the torchlight. The King sat high on his stool, guarded by Kojo Bempah, whose hand never strayed far from the hilt of his ivory-hilted sword.</p>
“The kingdom is bleeding from within,” the King said gravely. “We must act, or the blood will rise to drown the golden stool.”</p>
Old Chief Nana Kofi Boahen, the linguist of the Eastern provinces, stood with the aid of his staff. “Nana, the blood begins with gold. The stolen stool from Aduem is not just an artifact - it was a pledge of loyalty. Its theft is an act of war.”</p>
Kojo Bempah leaned forward. “Then let us declare war. Root out the traitors. Burn the bush to flush out the snake.”</p>
But Queen Akosua rose and countered him. “A snake will not run from fire- it hides deeper in the roots. We must not just strike. We must understand who fed the snake.”</p>
The council murmured. The Queen’s words unsettled them, for they hinted at a deeper rot.</p>
Unknown to the King, Kojo Bempah had begun convening secret meetings under the guise of night patrols. Deep within the stone catacombs beneath the city -  once used to store gold dust - he met with discontented junior chiefs, palace guards, and ambitious traders. His words were sharp and calculated:</p>
“Did our ancestors fight the British just to kneel under one man’s reforms? The King gives the white men treaties, reduces our tributes, and limits your share of the royal earnings. And who whispers into his ear at night? A woman!”</p>
He paced before them, his voice rising.</p>
“The Ashanti Empire was built on conquest, not compromise. It’s time the throne returned to warriors - not talkers.”</p>
Cheers echoed through the stone walls. A plan was laid - to assassinate not the King, but Queen Akosua, whose influence was stronger than many realized.</p>
</p>
While the Queen remained inside the palace grounds, she had eyes everywhere. Afia Mensima, her handmaiden, moved freely between palace and market. Trained in listening more than speaking, she heard of a gathering planned in the city’s north quarter - strange for a day with no funeral or festival.</p>
Afia rushed back, panting.</p>
“My Queen, there’s a plot. They plan to strike during the festival of Akwasidae. You are their target.”</p>
The Queen did not flinch. Instead, she went to her private shrine and prayed before the effigy of Yaa Asantewaa, lighting a single flame.</p>
“If the stool must be defended by women again,” she whispered, “let it be so.”</p>
The day arrived. Kumasi blossomed with color - crimson, gold, and deep green fabrics flowing through the streets. Drummers pounded rhythms that told stories older than memory. Dancers performed in circles, and libations were poured to the ancestors.</p>
The King, robed in fine kente and flanked by guards, took his seat atop a raised platform. Queen Akosua walked beside him in majestic silence, a golden eagle feather in her hair - a signal to those who knew that she was watching.</p>
Among the crowd, hidden beneath ceremonial clothes, Kojo Bempah’s men waited for a signal. One was dressed as a drummer. Another carried a disguised blade in a calabash. Their target was not the King, but the Queen. Without her, the King’s inner circle would fracture.</p>
But the Queen had anticipated this. She had quietly replaced the real palace guards with her own loyal fighters - women trained in knife combat, dressed as dancers.</p>
As the crowd shouted and danced, a drummer inched closer to the royal dais, raising his stick not to beat, but to strike.</p>
In a flash, a dancer spun, kicked the calabash out of his hand, and drew a blade from beneath her cloth. Chaos erupted.</p>
“Assassins!” someone cried.</p>
The King stood, fury in his voice. “Secure the Queen!”</p>
But Queen Akosua had already moved, dragging her startled husband down the back of the platform as arrows flew through the air. One struck the stool where he had just been seated.</p>
Kojo Bempah, standing at the edge of the square, realized too late that the plan had failed. Blood spilled in the square, but not the Queen’s. His men were overwhelmed by the women warriors - graceful, precise, and merciless.</p>
The King turned to his wife, shaken.</p>
“You knew this was coming.”</p>
“I warned you,” she said coldly. “But you refused to see the fire under your own roof.”</p>
</p>
That night, Kojo Bempah fled the city with a small band of loyalists, heading toward the dense forests of the Offin River. He hoped to regroup, to rally the outer villages where his influence remained.</p>
But he didn’t make it far.</p>
Queen Akosua dispatched a unit of elite scouts - led by Afia Mensima and two of the Queen’s former bodyguards - to track him. At dawn on the third day, they caught him at a watering hole, drinking from a calabash.</p>
Surrounded, Kojo Bempah didn’t beg. He drew his sword and shouted:</p>
“I am Ashanti! I will not die on my knees!”</p>
Afia stepped forward. “Then you will die as you lived - with ambition, but without honour.”</p>
She struck the final blow.</p>
</p>

The execution of Kojo Bempah sent shockwaves through the kingdom. His body, wrapped in leopard skin as was customary for warriors, was paraded quietly at dawn and buried without rites. No drum beat. No libation. A silence more damning than any decree.</p>
But peace did not return immediately.</p>
Within the royal court, tension lingered like harmattan dust. Some chiefs who once supported Bempah now feigned ignorance, others fawned over the King with sudden loyalty. Yet King Kwarteng knew - loyalty offered in fear was like dry wood: it burned too fast.</p>
Queen Akosua, meanwhile, retreated from public life for several days. Rumors filled Kumasi like smoke: some said she was sick, others that the Queen was communing with spirits. The truth was more complicated.</p>
She was building a case.</p>

In Ashanti tradition, betrayal from within could not go unpunished - not just by sword, but by custom. So Queen Akosua invoked an ancient rite long forgotten: “The Trial of the Stools.” It was a sacred gathering where each divisional chief had to re-declare allegiance by swearing on their own stool - and reveal any knowledge of treason.</p>
The court convened in the shadow of the great Baobab tree near Bantama. The golden stools of every chief were brought forth and cleansed with river water. Drummers played slowly - not the rhythms of war, but of remembrance.</p>
The Queen, veiled in white, spoke before them.</p>
“Our kingdom cannot be ruled by fear, nor by ambition alone. The golden stool is more than power - it is trust.”</p>
She turned to the King.</p>
“Let those who know of treachery speak, or let the ancestors tear the truth from their throats.”</p>
One by one, the chiefs stood, touching their stools and reciting oaths of loyalty. But not all were clean.</p>
Nana Osei Dapaah, the chief of Ejisu, hesitated. Sweat beaded on his brow. He had once accepted gold from Bempah - not to join him, but to remain silent. Now silence became guilt.</p>
“I… I failed the throne. I knew. I said nothing.”</p>
Gasps. The King rose, his jaw tight.</p>
“Do you ask for mercy?”</p>
The old man shook his head. “I ask for justice. I am ready.”</p>
In front of the whole council, Nana Osei Dapaah was stripped of his stool. It was crushed before him - a ritual death. His lands were reassigned to his junior brother.</p>
Justice, swift and symbolic.</p>

After the trials, King Kwarteng began reforms with the Queen’s counsel. Corruption was rooted out. Revenue systems were rebuilt. Trade was restored with the Dagomba and Bono. Even the British, watching carefully from the coast, realized Kumasi was not as divided as they hoped.</p>
But still, shadows lingered. Not all betrayals were visible.</p>
One night, the King sat with the Queen under the moonlight in the royal garden. Fireflies danced around them. He held her hand, heavy with golden rings.</p>
“You saved the throne, Akosua. Not with war - but with wisdom.”</p>
She looked at him, her voice low.</p>
“You’re still King, Kwarteng. But remember this: power must be held with humility, or it will consume even the noble-hearted.”</p>
He nodded slowly.</p>
“And you… you are the drum that warns before the storm. I was foolish to ever silence your rhythm.”</p>
She smiled, but her eyes remained distant.</p>
“The drums never sleep, my King. Even when the palace does.”</p>
In the months that followed, Kumasi entered a period of fragile calm. The scent of rebellion faded from the air, replaced by the aroma of new yam, smoked fish, and shea. Traders returned to the city square, and the drumbeat of Kumasi shifted from suspicion to strength.</p>
But the palace had changed.</p>
The Council of Elders, once bloated with age and flattery, had been trimmed like an overgrown tree. In their place rose a younger generation of advisors, many of whom were former lieutenants of Kojo Bempah—reformed and tested through fire. The King believed in offering redemption to those willing to confess and serve honorably. To rule a kingdom, he’d learned, one must both punish and forgive.</p>
The Queen’s influence grew, though she wore it with quiet grace. She refused any formal title beyond her role as wife and mother of the empire, but everyone knew: Akosua Serwaa was the spine of the golden stool.</p>
Young girls in Kumasi now studied proverbs, not just domestic crafts. The Queen had established a secret circle - Ahenemma Ntoaso, meaning “Daughters of the Stool” - to train future female leaders in diplomacy, healing, and war.</p>
Even Afia Mensima, the once-quiet handmaiden, was now referred to as Ahenni Ba, the King's Daughter by Honor, a title never before given to a non-royal. She had earned it not by blood, but by bravery.</p>
A Kingdom in Reflection</p>
As the next Akwasidae approached, the city prepared again - not for survival, but for celebration. Drums rang with confidence, not caution. Cloth merchants dyed new kente in colors to honor peace: blue for wisdom, green for renewal, and gold for unity.</p>
During the festival, the King stood before the people and raised his staff.</p>
“We have been tested by fire,” he declared. “But the gold remains. Let the world know: Kumasi is not ruled by fear, but by legacy. We do not run from truth. We sit with it, even when it burns.”</p>
The crowd roared, and for the first time in a long while, their cheer was unforced.</p>
Later, under the sacred tree in the palace courtyard, the Queen sat weaving cloth. The King approached and sat beside her, his royal staff leaned gently against the roots.</p>
“What are you weaving?” he asked softly.</p>
She smiled, without looking up.</p>
“A new future. One thread at a time.”</p>
A Whisper from the Ancestors</p>
One night, Queen Akosua dreamed of Yaa Asantewaa. The warrior queen stood before her in full battle regalia, her voice echoing like a horn through time.</p>
“You stood when others bowed. You saw when others slept. Let the stool be guarded not only by warriors, but by watchers.”</p>
The Queen woke with tears on her cheeks. She rose quietly and walked barefoot to the shrine, lighting three candles — one for the past, one for the present, and one for the unborn.</p>
In that moment, she understood something the King was only beginning to grasp:</p>
 The kingdom’s survival would not depend on the strength of swords or the wealth of gold—but on the courage to confront truth, generation after generation.</p>

Years passed. The golden leaves of Kumasi’s sacred trees fell and grew again. Children who had once played in palace courtyards were now messengers, scribes, farmers, and guards. Time, ever steady, marched forward - but the memory of the great betrayal and the trial of justice lived on in the songs of griots and the stories of elders.</p>
Queen Akosua, now older, walked more slowly through the palace grounds, her steps lighter, her voice deeper. She had become a living legend - Obaa a ɔkyerɛ ɔman kwan, meaning “the woman who guided a nation.”</p>
Yet, she never claimed glory. When visitors from distant regions came to hear the tale, she always began the same way:</p>
“It was not I who saved Kumasi. It was truth. And truth wears no crown.”</p>
One evening, as the sun melted behind the hills and turned the palace red and gold, her grandson, a boy of ten, approached her. He carried a small talking drum, carved with the images of lions and eagles.</p>
“Nana,” he said. “Why do the drums never stop during Akwasidae? Even when it’s quiet, I still hear them.”</p>
Queen Akosua smiled. She placed a wrinkled hand on the boy’s chest.</p>
“That is because the real drum is not in the marketplace, or the palace. It is here. It beats for justice. For courage. For our people.”</p>
The boy leaned against her, comforted not just by her warmth but by the rhythm of a people who had endured, adapted, and survived.</p>
“Will I be king one day?” he asked.</p>
She looked at him carefully.</p>
“Only if you remember what we nearly lost. Power is not a gift - it is a burden. You must carry it with clean hands, or not at all.”</p>

                        <p>I am Lawrence Kwabena Sabla, an IT professional and storyteller who finds balance between the structured world of technology and the boundless realm of creative writing. I currently serve as an IT manager, a role that allows me to manage the technical heart of one of the country's leading digital media platforms. My passion for reading and writing is what drives my creativity. I believe that being a writer is much like being a web developer; both require patience, attention to detail, and a commitment to building something meaningful from scratch. My story, “The Trusted Drums of Kumasi,” which placed third in the Simple Script Writers Project 2025, is a reflection of my deep love for our cultural heritage. I was inspired to write this story by a desire to explore the rhythmic history of the Asante Kingdom. I wanted to capture how traditional communication: symbolized by the drums, acted as the heartbeat of a nation’s identity and resistance. By blending historical truth with fiction, I aim to make the stories of our ancestors feel alive for a new generation. For future writers, my advice is simple: Never be afraid to put your thoughts into writing, even if it is a draft. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s only through your words we can understand the beauty of the mind. </p>
